no cure yet for covid  or congress crisis. rahul gandhi continuously fails to win india
text size  a  a the congress conundrum is quite similar to the coronavirus crisis   both thrive on varied reasons and symptoms. just as there is no single medicine to cure covid     there is no one answer that addresses  let alone resolves  the congress conundrum. in the absence of any vaccine  social distancing has come to be a universally acceptable precaution against covid   . similarly  the need for a strong central leadership for the congress looks like the only possible shot at rebuilding the party. and just like only god knows when the pandemic might end  it is again only bhagwan who can tell us when the congress would become relevant again.not just routine loss of powerin a democratic polity  no party can remain in power forever  hence it is routine for them to win and lose elections. so  this cannot be the real reason for the current congress crisis. the bhartiya janata party  bjp   after being in power between      and       remained out of power for ten years          . yet  it was able to circumvent the sort of crises the congress is facing today. the grand old party  though  is unique in that it has faced large scale desertions even when in power with thumping majorities.in terms of ideology  it is reasonable to say that there has hardly been any change in the congress party s  official  ideology. clearly  the crisis within the congress cannot be ascribed to this. loose or strong  the ideological bonding of congress leaders has been historically consistent. indian voters may have some unease about the party s ideological leanings  but its leaders don t usually have to deal with such tensions.also read  bjp trying to topple my govt  history won t forgive this   ashok gehlot writes to pm modifactors determining congress crisisthere are three plausible and interrelated factors that could allude to the present crisis within the congress   feeble central leadership  generational divide  and the ambitious rants of the younger lot.let s look at the issue of the ambitious younger generation   is it wrong to be ambitious in politics  certainly not  because in the world we live in  politics is hardly a social service. instead  it is  in the weberian sense  a vocation  a lucrative career opportunity. political parties are said to be organised bodies with voluntary membership  which are in pursuit of political power. the ambition of their members is to capture top party positions and hold on to them for as long as they could.naturally  these features make parties prone to factions  defections  splits  and mergers. hence  parties have to be constantly on guard  and to be fair  the congress does have a record of successfully accomplishing that feat. recall the developments in                   and        when several congress leaders deserted the party to join other groups or formed their own organisations. most of those crises  however  were resolved only because of the congress  strong central leadership. any party facing an existential crisis is able to rebound   much to the chagrin of columnists writing obituaries of that party   only due to the effective leadership at the helm of its affairs. the bjp is an exemplar of such an argument  seemingly more focused on this count than the congress.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowthis brings us to the most crucial factor regarding the congress  weak central leadership. findings of the survey conducted by lokniti csds between      and      indicate that while the popularity of prime minister narendra modi has been rising over the years  in relative terms  rahul gandhi s appeal has been on a steady wane. in the beginning of       modi was the choice of only    per cent indians for the pm s post  while rahul gandhi was preferred by    per cent of the population. but by       modi s popularity went up to    per cent  while gandhi s declined to    per cent. even when jobless labourers were facing an existential crisis across the country due to the sudden announcement of covid    lockdown  evidence suggests that modi s popularity hardly declined. and in spite of rahul gandhi s efforts  people did not recognise him as a promising leader. clearly  the congress has its tasks cut out.also read  congress       style treatment of young leaders won t work. it can learn from bjpwidening generational dividesuch weak central leadership then provides an opportunity for the emergence of generational divide between the elder and younger leaders  where the former stake their claim on experience  while the later demand their pound of flesh on dynamisms. unfortunately  the congress  top leadership also seems torn between these two choices. the latest crisis in its rajasthan unit has only strengthened this divide. in conjunction  these factors pose insurmountable challenges to what was once the  predominant party  in india s political landscape  primarily on account of its accommodative spirit.factions causing some kind of crisis are inherent in party politics and can be seen as normal. in some political parties it is more than normal  while in others it could be uncommon or subdued. the issue is about managing these factions or growing sections of dissent  and that depends a lot on its leaders  their crises management abilities and their style of functioning.but the severity  span and the range of crises that the congress party faces appears despairingly interminable. however  if the democratic spirit is about choices and alternatives  then a reawakened and assertive congress is a necessity for the resilient operation of india s parliamentary democracy. the way ahead  though  will be shaped by how the party s top leadership responds to the many challenges. will it take them head on  or see them through as just another

in rahul gandhi  jaishankar picks an easy target. modi govt s real task is to push china back
text size  a  a congress leader rahul gandhi shed the politician s uniform  the white kurta pyjama  for a light blue boardroom shirt in two beautifully   and expensively   shot videos over the last week  as he attempted to pin the narendra modi government down on its foreign policy mistakes  especially on china.in the first video released on    july  gandhi asked  why has china chosen this particular time to violate the line of actual control  lac  in ladakh since       the pm s constant blunders and indiscretions have fundamentally weakened india and left us vulnerable. empty words don t suffice in the world of geopolitics. pic.twitter.com xm pxcrufh   rahul gandhi   rahulgandhi  july         in the second video  posted on    july  gandhi pointed out that the chinese don t do anything without thinking about strategy  so what s their tactical and strategic game plan pm fabricated a fake strongman image to come to power. it was his biggest strength. it is now india s biggest weakness. pic.twitter.com ifaplkfpvv   rahul gandhi   rahulgandhi  july         perhaps the question to be asked here is how rahul gandhi found the time to make these china videos   notice the care with which they have been shot  the ombre merging into a dark background  the post production work showing up his tanned lines   but hasn t said a word in defence of his former friend and colleague  sachin pilot  who has been roundly humiliated by senior congress leader ashok gehlot these last few days.clearly  rahul gandhi would rather speak of the enemy at the gates in ladakh instead of addressing the enemy within. a leader who cannot protect his own  who would stand by and allow the older generation to eat their young  how can he protect india when it is in trouble   never mind that the congress party is thrilled that their dear leader s second china video has been trending on twitter all morning in response to rahul s first video  external affairs minister s. jaishankar let fly a storm of    tweets. unlike gandhi  jaishankar certainly doesn t want to be prime minister   he knows he has unprecedented power already. but loyalty to the pm demanded that he respond to the congress leader  even if it meant unfairly targeting the previous government that did not fall because of foreign policy miscalculations   and even if the attack on the past showed up his own ministry in bad light.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowso let s analyse five of jaishankar s responses to rahul gandhi  . sj  india engages with china on more equal terms politically.it is true that pm modi has met china s top leader  president xi jinping  more times than any previous leader  which is a good thing. but modi s team is certainly emboldened by soldiers such as    year old gurtej singh and several others  who displayed incredible courage on    june night on the frigid heights of the galwan valley  when they killed several chinese soldiers  including their commanding officer.the point here is that in dealing with the chinese  jaishankar should know that the moral high ground belongs to india  and not just pm modi.also read  balancing lac tension with economic strategy   how india can walk the tightrope against china . sj  we speak our mind more openly now ask the media. we speak our mind more openly now. on  cpec  on  bri  on south china sea  on un sanctioned terrorists  etc. ask the media.   dr. s. jaishankar   drsjaishankar  july         being a former diplomat  jaishankar understands dissent. he has dealt with journalists and tried to win them over because he knew it was important in order to spread india s message. but as eam  he presides over a ministry that would rather speak to journalists who agree with him.  don t call us  we ll call you   is his ministry s message. . sj  address the border infrastructure legacy  ask our jawans.  and address the  border infrastructure imbalance legacy. compare         with        . budget up by       road building by      bridges by     and tunnels by   times. ask our jawans.   dr. s. jaishankar   drsjaishankar  july         in this school of thought  the building of india can only be compared in six year blocks  because modi has completed   years in power. it doesn t matter that manmohan singh was pm from            during which period the china study group first proposed that border infrastructure should be vastly improved. to its credit  modi has carried that idea forward  as he should have.but what if jaishankar were to also look up the previous six year period  when atal bihari vajpayee was pm and under whom the special representative mechanism with china was set up  he will find that infrastructure along the border with china was either non existent or abysmal.also read  modi s underrated strategy of neutralising criticism helps him retain the teflon coating . sj  nepal after    years is getting  a swathe of developmental projects. ask their citizens.  nepal after    years is getting prime ministerial visits. and a swathe of developmental projects  power  fuel  housing  hospital  roads  etc. ask their citizens.   dr. s. jaishankar   drsjaishankar  july         someone badly messed up on this tweet. in       the modi government decided to support the madhesi agitation  in       the ministry of external affairs failed to understand the anti india politics of communist leader k.p. oli  and in       nepal is releasing new maps claiming disputed territory as its own. from      onwards  india s nepal policy has gone only in one direction  southward. . sj  and pakistan notes the difference between balakot   uri on the one hand and sharm el sheikh  havana         on the other ask yourself. and  pakistan  that you skipped  surely notes the difference between balakot   uri on the one hand  and sharm el sheikh  havana         on the other. ask yourself.   dr. s. jaishankar   drsjaishankar  july         one wonders what jaishankar would have said about vajpayee s lahore bus ride in       the ic     hijacking that saw the vajpayee government give up three terrorists  and then  only two years later  invite pervez musharraf  the author of the kargil conflict  to peace talks in agra  and when all those measures failed  vajpayee didn t give up but set up another summit in january      with musharraf in pakistan so  the question is  should jaishankar resist the temptation to score political points off an opposition leader   rahul gandhi  in this case   who doesn t really know better  surely  the good eam knows that there are several people with longer memories and better understanding of context rahul gandhi is an easy target. the tough work will come when the modi government will have to use all its persuasive power as well as its friendships with powerful nations like the us and russia to get china to fully withdraw on its own side of the lac.one last question  who sanctioned pm modi s talking points at the    june all party meeting on the chinese intrusion in ladakh  when the pm said  no one had intruded into indian territory or taken any post   everything the government has done subsequently is to tiptoe around that statement and walk back the chinese on the ground. can someone in the mea explain that one  please views are personal.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis   only you can fix it you are

sachin pilot s political graph saw a steep rise  before it nosedived between congress and bjp
text size  a  a on an early winter morning in november       sachin pilot arrived at chhan village   part of the tonk assembly segment that he was contesting from in the upcoming rajasthan state election   mounted on top of a mare. an otherwise assertive pilot  always exuding confidence  smiled sheepishly when the women of the village rushed to tie him rakhis.but his next move came almost naturally   pilot went ahead  greeted the village sarpanch and asked him about his kids.  whenever he would visit a village where his father had a connection  he would immediately remind the sarpanch of their time together   said mohammad iqbal  a senior journalist based out of rajasthan who travelled with pilot s convoy in the run up to the      election.pilot  whose father died in a tragic car accident in       was all too aware of his dynast image  and wished to go out of his way to seem like a  grounded politician   and  rajasthan s son . part of this required him to  look and sound  a certain way and carry that well crafted image to ensure his acceptability among the masses.showing off his ability to wear the traditional safa in less than    seconds  and greeting everyone he met on his campaign trail with a  ram ram sa  was in sync with his effort.whatever pilot did  seemed to work like a charm. the congress party came back to power in rajasthan defeating the bharatiya janata party  bjp   although by a slim margin of      . with support of independents and other allies  as well as from the bahujan samaj party  bsp  mlas who joined the party  the congress was able to form the government with     seats in the     member assembly.eighteen months later  pilot  who steered his party to victory  was sacked from the posts of the deputy chief minister as well as the rajasthan congress chief. contrary to all speculations  he insists he has no intention of joining the bjp  even as the congress leadership accuses him of hobnobbing with the party.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowwhere the rajasthan leader would land after boarding his flight of political rebellion is still a guesswork in progress in the political circles  from delhi to jaipur  and this is why sachin pilot is theprint s newsmaker of the week.also read  sachin pilot   co will be   th breakaway from congress. but only    survived on their owndynasty roots and the headstartit s widely been said that while rajasthan chief minister ashok gehlot was busy discharging his responsibilities as the all india congress committee  aicc  general secretary  it was sachin pilot who led the party to victory in the      assembly election. but that was his job as the state party chief  i don t get why people go so overboard in appreciating him for it. he only did what his job was   sandeep dikshit  former congress mp and son of former delhi chief minister sheila dikshit  told theprint.the role of pilot s  dynasty roots  are often underplayed in the analysis of his career trajectory  leaders argue.after rajesh pilot s sudden death in       his wife rama pilot took over as mp of dausa lok sabha seat after winning the byelection. four years later     year old sachin pilot won from the same constituency  becoming the youngest parliamentarian back then. it was also the year he married sara abdullah   daughter of farooq abdullah  former chief minister of jammu and kashmir.  do you think i or sachin pilot or jyotiraditya scindia would have ever won our first elections if we weren t sons of former congress leaders  you can t claim to be an ace runner when you were given a headstart in a race   dikshit said.an mba graduate from wharton school  pilot s close aides say he imbued the party with a  corporate zeal  after being made the rajasthan pradesh congress committee chief in     .but he felt he was given  the raw end of the deal  when he was made the deputy cm in       and purportedly continued to face humiliation thereafter.pilot was reportedly not informed about the six bsp mlas joining the congress. a booklet released by the gehlot government on its achievements skipped any mention of pilot and his ministries. he accepted the post and tried to adjust. but over the last two years  he was choking. he wasn t invited for the important celebrations  he wasn t kept in the loop about major policy decisions   a close aide of pilot said.pilot and    other  rebel  mlas from his camp were served a disqualification notice wednesday over alleged  anti party  activities. the congress has gone on to release audios of alleged conversations between mlas from the pilot camp and bjp leaders planning to topple the gehlot government. investigation will reveal whether this is true. but if pilot does join bjp  it will raise a greater question on just how ideologically weak and unstable congress is  and how flexible its young turks are   said a senior congress leader requesting anonymity.also read  sachin pilot is not himanta biswa. every congress rebel cannot win elections for bjpparallels with scindiain an off the cuff episode from october       pilot can be seen emphatically defending the congress as a party that encourages young talent  and enumerating his umpteen accomplishments. i became mp at    i became minister at     i became party president at     and if i still want more from the party  then i think it s wrong. it s time for me to give back to the party   pilot had said.pilot was sharing the stage with another young scion of the congress   jyotiraditya scindia  who joined the bjp in march this year and toppled the kamal nath government in madhya pradesh by what was nothing short of a coup.in the course of the same discussion  on being asked whether the congress should have a cm face in madhya pradesh and rajasthan before the      assembly elections  pat came scindia s pithy reply  yes.but pilot took his time and gave a much more diplomatic  leader esque response about  taking everyone together   a stance often taken by the congress before an election or after a victory. i don t think it s right for us to have just one  cm  face in rajasthan  we should have      pilot had said.despite the differences between their style and stance  comparisons between scindia and pilot have often been made  mostly clubbing them together as congress  young turks.for dikshit  however  there is one major difference between the two    scindia is insufferably arrogant and pilot is sufferably arrogant. both scindia and pilot were seen as rahul gandhi s  chosen ones    the favourite confidantes. i would see this young lot sitting together in parliament   pilot  scindia  jitin prasada and others  but i had little to do with them   mani shankar aiyar told theprint.soon after  however  aiyar sat up and took notice of pilot when the latter was made the minister of corporate affairs in      under manmohan singh led upa ii.pilot fielded questions from everyone  including then leader of opposition arun jaitley who would go on to succeed the ministry  albeit in a senior role. i saw him pilot the companies act with a total command in the subject and a real eye for detail. his ability to answer on his feet without consulting people around him really impressed me   aiyar said.in a column in the indian express  aiyar has rued over the fact that rahul gandhi is often betrayed by those he loves the most  scindia and now pilot. but it s worth wondering why he gets betrayed like this  why he isn t able to retain confidantes. i think the problem isn t that he chooses  young  people  but that he doesn t choose the right kind of young people. he chooses people whose personal ambitions override the party s   a senior congress leader told theprint on condition of anonymity.sixty nine year old gehlot also snubbed pilot and his perceived image of being a well spoken  delhi media friendly politician.  speaking good english  giving good quotes and being handsome isn t everything. what is in your heart for the country  your ideology  policies and commitment  everything is important   gehlot said earlier this week.former assam chief minister and congress leader tarun gogoi has slammed the young party leaders of the congress  including his son gaurav gogoi  for thinking that chief minister ship is their  birthright . the problem with these young people   even my own son i will say   didn t come from the grassroots. a grassroot leader understands all the challenges and troubles   gogoi said in an interview.congress mp gaurav gogoi said he  wholeheartedly  agrees with the sentiment of his father.also read  sachin pilot has done the unthinkable   united all tv channels from ndtv to republicis ambition a virtue but many other younger leaders of the party argue that  ambition  isn t a quality that should be looked down upon.pradyot manikya deb barman  the former president of the congress in tripura  broke rank from the party last year over differences with the high command  which he said was  not serious in handling young leadership. however  barman did not join the bjp  but went on to form the indigenous progressive regional alliance or tipra  which he describes as the  principal opposition  to the bjp in the state.from sharad pawar in maharashtra to mamata banerjee in west bengal  there is enough precedence for pilot to follow if he wants to form his own party in the state. he shifted base to jaipur  next to the party headquarters after becoming the party president. and even before that  he took part in protests for the gujjar community and faced arrests   saud saidi  former president of the tonk district congress committee  said.saidi says pilot has garnered enough support among the masses   particularly mastering the caste combination. gujjars and meenas are historically seen as rivals here. but if you see the mlas in his camp  it has equal numbers from both communities  which is a great success   saidi said.political analyst and a visiting fellow at policy think tank observer research foundation  rasheed kidwai agrees that pilot would be able to lead a third front   but not until     .  rajasthan has been a two party state. and in today s age the lines are very clear  you are either pro bjp or anti bjp . so even if he does form his third front  he will first have to wait until the next assembly election to do that. but the rebel mlas wouldn t stick along with him for that long. and even after that  he will have to choose his allegiance as an ally to a party   kidwai added.views are personal.subscribe to our channels on youtube

why it s so important for bjp to snatch power in congress ruled states
text size  a  a why is it so important to capture state governments though you did not get the voters  mandate  one answer could be that it helps to have control of the state administration for whenever the next elections are held. police and other officials can be transferred as required to facilitate the ruling party s campaigning  made to look the other way when skulduggery is on  like moving voters  bribe money into a constituency   or deployed to engineer the support of local influencers and toughs.there is a less obvious possibility  much of the money that can be milked from the government system for political use is at state  not central  level. the double benefit is that the same money can be denied to the opposition  which by definition is already at a disadvantage because it does not have access to the funds that control of the central government can help generate. businessmen are usually willing to pay because their life can be made difficult or facilitated by the centre s  agencies   taxmen  bank officials  the infamous  phone banking    and sector regulators who hand out convenient decisions.while such funding is large and important  the fiscal reality as it has evolved puts the bulk of the government money in the hands of the states  not the centre. the latter s total expenditure last year was about rs    lakh crore  but most of that was pre committed. pay and pensions for over one crore employees and pensioners  interest payments on government debt  climbing rapidly   and transfers to the states  more generous than in the past  accounted in more or less equal measure for a combined total of nearly three quarters of the whole. discretionary spending by the centre was  therefore  no more than about rs   lakh crore. against this  the states spent rs    lakh crore  of which pre empted expenditure was much less than for the centre. interest payments  for instance  were less than    per cent of the central bill.also read  health a state subject  but covid proved how dependant india s states are on centreso if there is money to be made out of kickbacks on government payouts  much of the bigger opportunities are in the states. think irrigation and road construction contracts  deals on liquor excise and mining leases  as in karnataka s reddy brothers and the riches of ballari   and purchases of all kinds  power by state discoms  coal by power generating stations  fodder by animal husbandry departments  tendu leaf purchase contracts  the list is long . what is more  there is usually less scrutiny of state level deals  unless you are unlucky like lalu prasad.control of a state government or two is  therefore  crucial for the effective functioning of a party in the wilderness like the congress. one reason why its chief ministers have been so powerful is that it is they who fund the party at the centre. think back to the power wielded by y.s. rajasekhara reddy  and the rapid acquisition of wealth by his son  and bhupinder singh hooda  all those permissions for change of land use   among others.to snatch a state government out of congress hands is therefore a high stakes game with national political implications  for it denies the party the essential fuel to run effective election campaigns. the price of a state legislator who is willing to switch party affiliation may seem large if it stretches  as various accounts have it  from rs    crore to rs    crore. but for bagging    or    legislators and swinging the balance in the assembly  a war chest big enough to hold rs     crore is well worth putting out  if that means denying a rival party the riches of a state exchequer  similar  in historical terms  to bribing mir jaffer to pocket  in due course  the diwani of bengal .what is more  since the congress has little prospect of being anything more than a minor player in some large and medium states  bihar  up  maharashtra  west bengal  tamil nadu  andhra pradesh   control of the bigger ones among the rest like karnataka  madhya pradesh  and rajasthan becomes all the more important for its continuance as an effective force. the obverse is that denying these states to the congress becomes crucial for achieving the declared goal of a  congress mukt  bharat.also read  elections have become meaningless in india   the bjp wins even when it losessubscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media

text size  a  a sometime in      when senior congress leader arjun singh was having a titanic battle of supremacy with then prime minister and aicc chief p.v. narasimha rao  i remember running into congress general secretary buddha priya maurya. he was a dalit leader from uttar pradesh where a large number of congress leaders and workers had turned against rao. so  i asked maurya a provocative question on why he was not supporting arjun singh. maurya was not offended. in his measured voice  he said   i hail from atrauli  aligarh where there is a saying that one wishes for a son in law or leader better than oneself. and i do not consider arjun to be better than me. in the ongoing tussle between sachin pilot and the congress high command  the personality of rahul gandhi and his impending return as the   th president of the indian national congress is posing a similar resistance. like jyotiraditya scindia  pilot and a few others  who will probably quit the party in the months to come   fancy themselves as tad better than rahul  in political acumen  social and management skills. post the      lok sabha election  many current and erstwhile members of  team rahul  are beginning to look down on him. instead of narendra modi as heir tormentor and wrecker in chief  in private conversations  they blame rahul gandhi for their defeat.the congress narrative of rewarding sachin pilot with a lok sabha berth at the age of     ministerial responsibility at    and post of deputy chief minister at    is proving to be counter productive because many young dynasts  who have been beneficiaries of similar largesse and patronage  deeply resent this  mai baap  culture. according to them  the meteoric rise of pilot  scindia  milind deora  jitin prasada  priya dutt   all second or third generation dynasts   was a result of their sweat and in spite of the gandhis.if pilot indeed breaks away from the congress  it will be the   th time the grand old party will be witnessing some kind of split.also read  why it s unfair to blame ashok gehlot or congress for sachin pilot s unreasonable ambitionsa third forcecongress ideologue v.n. gadgil would say congress leaders quit the party as lions and return as lambs. there is a grain of truth in it   just about    breakaway outfits survived  including some under illustrious figures like sharad pawar  mamata banerjee  jagan mohan reddy  k. chandrashekhar rao  and mufti mohammad sayeed.if pilot s rebellion does not go the scindia way  and if the gandhi family doesn t placate him enough  there is a third way  he can break away and form a regional party. but there is a flip side too. each time the congress faced a third party in a state  it found itself marginalised. delhi  andhra pradesh  telangana  west bengal  maharashtra  uttar pradesh and bihar are some such states where the congress staging a comeback on its own has become a distant dream.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for

would be carving a niche for himself in rajasthan while maintaining equal distance from the bjp and the congress. any tacit or direct alliance with the bjp would foreclose the  third force  option. if

require tremendous patience  application and resisting the constant temptation of high offices. more importantly  keeping elected representatives on his side would be extremely demanding.also read

 simply because  jitty  bhai was shown black flags and found state party unit offices shut when he tried convincing district and state level party delegates.a political life outside the congress would not be easy for sachin pilot unless he travels on the scindia path of either joining or aligning with the bjp. a third front in rajasthan is non existent as of now. there is no dearth of congress

sachin pilot is not himanta biswa. every congress rebel cannot win elections for bjp
text size  a  a barely    hours after kicking out its  young and promising leader  sachin pilot from the post of rajasthan deputy chief minister and state unit president  the congress appealed to him to return to the party and sort out  any differences  he might have with chief minister ashok gehlot.for now  sachin pilot has made clear that he is not joining the bharatiya janata party  bjp   which was all too eager to welcome the congress leader  as well as perhaps the    mlas who support him  into its fold. but there are a few things that the bjp must keep in mind.it is no secret anymore that there are many disgruntled elements in the congress wishing to quit the  sinking ship . the bjp s resolve of a  congress mukt bharat  is seemingly being implemented by the congress.so  sachin pilot s declaration cannot be considered a solemn promise made under oath. as the events unfold  there could be many more surprises. in such a scenario  the bjp would do well to listen to internal

commitment or selfless service and sacrifice.in a cadre based party like the bjp  such late comers and back door entrants from the opposition camp seem to add very little value. it is even more pertinent in rajasthan  where the bjp has good cadre strength  deep roots and popular leadership at all levels.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions.

on the strength of outstanding charisma of prime minister narendra modi and superb strategies of home minister amit shah. the newcomers rarely add any value to the party.the bjp may fancy improving its prospects of victory in constituencies where the rebel leader s influence is greater  and  as elections approach  the number of rebels wishing to join it would arguably increase  but the party must still watch out for unintended consequences and listen to the voices within.also read  congress loses big when a pilot or scindia rebels but the  privileged  are ultimate losersanother crisis for

so  sachin pilot  who is credited with winning the state for the congress  would take over the reigns from the cm. but the fact remains that gehlot s contribution was nothing to be overlooked  considering the old war horse is endowed with vast experience in strategising and governance.his  magic   gehlot is believed to have learned magic tricks from his father  worked in maharashtra where the congress  according to him  had given up even before the election. speaking at an event  he had said   realising that the party couldn t succeed  they  congress in maharashtra and haryana  stopped trying to make any effort to win the assembly elections. the party should fight elections with all their strength and energy and not with a defeatist mindset. at a time when he was widely expected to play an important role in the party at the centre  he was shifted to rajasthan and had to fight for his supremacy.  i deserved to be the cm   ashok gehlot had said in july     .  it was clear who

high investments in public life and long years to go would certainly be worried about his her return on investments and hence look for greener pastures in the bjp.it is not surprising that while rahul gandhi remained low key in the rebellion episode  priyanka gandhi  in the middle of shifting house  reportedly called pilot four times and asked him not to quit the party even if he was not attending meetings called by cm gehlot.political parties are increasingly becoming leader oriented rather than ideology based. indispensability of leadership flies against the basic tenets of democracy. the first family of the congress is proving to be a liability for the party. at some stage  highly talented individuals could make an exit  cobble up another platform and float a new avatar under a new

pilot  scindia rebellion not because of top leadership. congress  crisis is structural
text size  a  a the defection of jyotiraditya scindia and the rebellion of sachin pilot has brought the congress party s internecine politics to the fore. a standard narrative around these rebellions is that the congress party can no longer retain its popular  younger leaders and that the central leadership  i.e.  the gandhi trio   sonia  rahul  and priyanka   are to be blamed. in our view  this is rather simplistic and maybe a misplaced understanding of why the congress party is imploding. in reality  the current crisis in the congress party is structural.let us begin with some plain facts. all parties in india have a factional conflict. even the cadre based parties like the bharatiya janata party  bjp  or the communist party of india  marxist   or family run parties like the samajwadi party  sp  or the nationalist congress party  ncp  are not an exception. after all  parties are made up of factions. it is the role of the party leaders to manage the emerging competition among the factions. sometimes  the factional management is handled by the state unit. in other cases  the central leadership has to intervene to sort out factional conflict. this is a long standing feature of indian party politics.also read  sachin pilot has done the unthinkable   united all tv channels from ndtv to republicwhere lies the blame scindia and pilot headed their factions in madhya pradesh and rajasthan. both sought more power representation for their wings or themselves. while pilot had ambitions to become the rajasthan chief minister  scindia wanted a more significant role in madhya pradesh. neither scindia nor pilot could attain their political goals.in mp and rajasthan  then  a less charitable but entirely plausible interpretation of the actions of both scindia and pilot is that while they led a minority faction yet they tried to hold the elected congress governments hostage. the steps taken by scindia and pilot make it a simple case of minority faction blackmail made possible because of ruthless electoral arithmetic. there is an opposition party  bjp  in both states with enough numbers to form the government with the help of  defectors . scindia was successful right away because the congress had far fewer seats to play within madhya pradesh. in rajasthan  the congress has a greater buffer and thus foiled pilot s attempt. in fact  the series of events in rajasthan since may      suggests that gehlot carefully precipitated a crisis  calculated the fallout at each step  and pilot got played.a dominant interpretation lays the blame for the congress party s crisis at the central leadership s doorstep. in this interpretation  scindia and pilot could have been mollified  appeased  accommodated  or given madhya pradesh and rajasthan s reins. there is an alternative interpretation. neither scindia nor pilot had enough mlas on their side for the congress leadership to put their weight behind their factions. according to news reports  pilot wished to be named as rajasthan cm in the coming days months. would the ashok gehlot faction  which is clearly the larger of the two  have accepted the central leadership s support to the smaller faction as a fait accompli  would they not have defected realpolitik would suggest that the congress leadership had no other option. it had to go with the larger faction. could it have intervened on pilot s behalf and moved some mlas from the gehlot faction  possibly. but  would that defection have been large enough to reduce the gehlot faction to less than    mlas  maybe  but possibly not.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowalso read  why it s unfair to blame ashok gehlot or congress for sachin pilot s unreasonable ambitionswhy the central leadership is in a spotcritics of the congress party blame the central leadership s inability to control minority factions  especially when they can destabilise state governments and rob the party of chances to establish itself as a contender for national power. it is beyond doubt that congress s central leadership is having difficulty in controlling minority factions because the party is no longer in power at the centre. while it is possible  but in the world of power politics  less plausible  that a party can be held together by the loyalty of state politicians to the central leadership. loyalty goes only so far  scindia and pilot s story are a good testament to this.when congress was in power in delhi  it could easily accommodate minority factions  interests in multiple ways. for example  it could give the minority faction some resources or share of power in the central government. moreover  the minority faction was aware that while their party is ruling in new delhi they have limited options. there were no real alternatives with whom the minority faction would have aligned without incurring a cost  read income tax raids etc . and thus  their threats to exit if the demands were not met  were less credible. a minority faction of the bjp in gujarat today cannot threaten the ruling government s stability because its threat is not credible. if it left the party where would it go  into the wilderness also read  covid delayed sachin pilot s revolt  he had planned exit in march  congress insiders claimfor long term gainsit is conceivable that the congress party s leadership has now decided to take short term losses for the party s longer term viability in states like madhya pradesh and rajasthan. maybe  it now expects the state units to solve its internecine conflicts by themselves. if younger politicians like scindia and pilot want to be successful  they have to work with other factions in their party  with leaders they do not like  and build a career from the ground up rather than rushing to delhi to defend them and their political ambitions. and herein lies the crux of the current crisis in the congress party. the gandhi trio should not expect young and ambitious politicians like scindia and pilot to fight the factional battles in their respective states when until now the central leadership has handed them positions of power on a platter  union ministries and state party chiefs.to sum up  power distribution in any party purely based on loyalty to the high command will sooner or later implode. especially  when the party is not in power. today the congress party s chances of acquiring power in new delhi in the immediate future appear bleak  and therefore minority factions can make credible threats to exit the organisation. state politicians of the congress are doing what faction leaders do all over the world   look for chances to enhance their power  either within the party or while the option still exists by exiting and either joining another party or forming a new outfit. the congress high command should be aware of its limitations in managing minority coalitions without power and resources. however  that is not an easy task and is a real test for any leader.pradeep chhibber is a

uttar pradesh into smaller statesbrahmin appeasement is not a new thingthis is not for the first time that the bsp and the congress are trying to woo the brahmins.rahul gandhi has gone too far to prove his kaul brahmin ancestry and also found out that he belongs to dattatreya gotra. the congress  structure is still brahmin dominated despite the party not getting substantial brahmin votes. this is the legacy of the past when the brahmins were the captive vote bank of the congress.the bsp has also gone the extra mile to adapt to sarvajan politics. it has appointed brahmins as leader of the party in both the houses of parliament lok sabha and rajya sabha. i can t recall any other national party to have ever done something like this. during the bsp government in up  the brahmins got the maximum number of cabinet berths. the bsp also fielded largest brahmin contingent in the      lok sabha election in up. despite that  all its brahmin candidates  other than ritesh pandey  lost. pandey won from ambedkar nagar seat. the district has around    per cent dalit population and negligible brahmin population.also read  the fundamental flaw in priyanka gandhi s uttar pradesh strategybut why have brahmins remained coy notwithstanding their outreach to the brahmin community  these parties are not getting any traction from them. according to the post poll survey by lokniti csds  more than    per cent brahmins in up voted for the bjp in      lok sabha election. this is in continuation with the pattern started in      lok sabha election  which was repeated in      assembly election.only the congress of yesteryears has enjoyed such loyalty of brahmin voters. the congress lost brahmin support in the     s and early     s. political scientist arvind kumar cites five primary reasons for the disenchantment of the brahmins from the congress and their flocking towards the bjp   . the implementation of mandal commission report and obc reservation in central government jobs and educational institutions   . the exodus of kashmiri pandits   . shah bano judgment and perceived act of the congress to appease the muslims   . aggressive assertion of the dalits and the obcs in the social and political space  especially the rise of kanshiram  mulayam singh and lalu prasad yadav   . proliferation of religious tv serials and resultant religiosity.after doing some brief experiments with regional political parties  the brahmins in north india  in       found their ultimate home in the bjp.the bjp is taking care of some of the main concerns of the brahmin community. the party has completely stopped the so called muslim appeasement  sachhar committee has demonstrated that this is entirely false notion  and rather started persecuting the minority through various means. some of these methods have the legal constitutional backing the citizenship amendment act and the national population register. other means include its offshoots indulging in mob lynchings  spreading the communal disharmony in the name of love jihad  spewing hate on social media and running campaigns to boycott muslim traders among others. the bjp has also acted decisively in jammu and kashmir by diluting article     and bifurcating the state. such acts too soothe the emotional wounds of the brahmins.the bjp is also working aggressively to restore the old brahminical caste order by undermining the provisions of reservation in government jobs and education. it has amended the article       and       to tweak the constitution so that the upper caste candidates can get    per cent ews reservation. though the congress and the bsp have supported the constitution amendment  the brahmins also know it well that these parties never took any initiative to implement savarna reservation.the narendra modi government is recruiting a large number of bureaucrats through lateral entry mechanism. this will also nullify some effects of the reservation policy. bjp led state governments have also placed the brahmins and the upper caste bureaucrats in key positions in ministries and other institutions.the modi government has also tried to nullify the sc st prevention of atrocities act. in       additional solicitor general maninder singh had told the supreme court that  in     of the cases filed under the act  the accused is acquitted and so these cases are fake.  this assertion of the law officer of the modi government had led to a judgment that had nearly finished the core objective of the sc st act. after nationwide protests  the government passed a bill to put the act back in its original shape.also read  on up s political turf  a new rivalry is unfolding  mayawati vs priyanka gandhibjp marinating the upper cast hegemonybrahmins have noticed the sincerity and honesty of the bjp in maintaining the hegemony of the caste structure. no other party can match the bjp in this arena as parties like the congress and the bsp have to cater to other voting blocs too. the congress can t shut the door on the muslims and the dalits  and the bsp can t antagonise its core dalit voters while appeasing the brahmins. this is a real catch    situation for the bsp as its core voters are ideologically trained to fight against the savarna hegemony  and if the party goes too far to woo the brahmins  then there is a chance that its core voters will desert it or may  at least  get disenchanted.but the main reason why the brahmins will not ditch the bjp is because in parties like the bsp  they will have a subservient role to play under a dalit dominated leadership. the experiment to include brahmins in the party undertaken by mayawati in the      up assembly election is a proof to this.today  both the bjp and bsp are trying to catch all  like the congress of yesteryears. the only difference between the two is that the bjp is wooing without disturbing the core of its political leadership it still cherishes the primacy of vedic hinduidm.even if there is a turf war going on between the thakurs and the brahmins in up  the bjp has enough elbow room to placate both the castes. as both the communities can be cajoled to see the muslims as common potent threat  and be convinced that only the bjp can keep the aspirations of the scs and the obcs in control  they will remain loyal to the party. there is no possibility of them joining the bsp or the

indian secularism still has a future if followers stop blame game with rss  rajmohan gandhi
text size  a  a this piece has been sparked by yogendra yadav s important article in theprint   this hindi book on indian secularism could have exposed liberals  but it was ignored.  i have not yet read abhay dubey s hindu ekta banam gyan ki rajniti  but the remarks that follow have been stimulated by yogendra s summary of the book s conclusions.read yogendra s article here  in which he lists several of dubey s crucial assessments  the defeat of secular politics is a defeat of secular ideology  the harsh truth that this defeat is well earned  the arrogance of the secular ideologues that made them overlook basic facts about the sangh parivar  and a quick reminder of the weaknesses of the secular politics   from exclusively focusing on minority rights to glossing over the congress  inconsistencies.many of the points that abhay dubey raises  and yogendra yadav summarises  are indisputable. defenders of secularism have often refused to look objectively at the sangh parivar  its diverse components  its strengths  weaknesses  achievements and failures. the failure of the congress to stand up to minority communalism over shah bano was an egregious blunder. but i am not so sure about the verdict that the secular ideology has been defeated.also read  this hindi book on indian secularism could have exposed liberals  but it was ignoredelection can t defeat what s in constitutionsome would argue  and i would join them  that the momentous defeats of secular politics during the last    plus years   first the lok sabha election results of         and then  after the    year spell of upa rule  the chain of defeats that began in        do not translate so readily into a defeat of secular ideology.without attempting a definition of  secular ideology   it may be suggested here that the preamble to our constitution  conveys  this ideology pretty well  and also that the rights to liberty and equality assured in the constitution give that ideology a solid grounding. today  we know  these rights are hardly secure. the wish to abrogate them may be seen all around us  and a climate may indeed be reached or created for an open attempt at abrogation.however  as long as  justice    liberty    equality    fraternity  and  the dignity of the individual  remain in the preamble  and are protected by our constitution s articles  we need not concede the secular ideology s defeat  and we must continue our protests against the steady flouting of the articles.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality

weaknesses for which they have been duly punished by our people  the ultimate rulers. but let us not forget that the latter   our crores of ranis  queens  and rajas  kings    repeatedly gave secular political parties the right to govern india. they did this  decade after decade  from      onwards. even after the      and      lok sabha elections  secular parties have received the popular mandate in several parts of india.also read  hate is hot in india. colder ideas like constitutional patriotism must work harder to winaccepting secularism despite deficienciesi will be the first to agree that india s governance was flawed from day one of swaraj. yet the congress party  holding aloft a much reviled banner of secular ideology  was elected again and again by our people  who knew that perfection does not exist on our soiled  if also sacred  dharti  land .the reviling of secular ideology had started before    august     . from the summer of       this condemnation was in violent flow. from much earlier  at least from the     s  a few muslim and hindu ideologues argued that hindus and muslims were two nations. the violence of          which was linked to the convulsing demand for partition  seemed to validate that belief.that s when a miracle happened. between      and       even as pakistan began its journey to an islamic state  and even while wounds of the      carnage were still fresh  india s leaders and constitution makers rejected the two nation ideology. thereafter  in elections held every five years  the people kept rejecting the two nation ideology even as they faced deficiencies in congress ministries at the centre and in the states.this is not the place to offer my understanding of how that miracle of         happened  but it seems undeniable that crucial to what unfolded was the clarity of several exceptional persons including m.k. gandhi  jawaharlal nehru  b.r. ambedkar  vallabhbhai patel  abul kalam azad  j.p. narayan and ram manohar lohia. all of them insisted that india belonged equally to hindus  muslims  sikhs  christians  everyone. that was the heart of their secular ideology.thanks to their uncompromising  publicly expressed and repeated stand against the two nation theory  and the backing they received from political and non political associates in the constituent assembly  the government  political parties and elsewhere  not only was our secular constitution put in place. secularism and pluralism seemed to enter india s bloodstream.that india belonged to all was accepted   it would appear   by the indian mind  which also seemed to recall that poets and saints had underlined that truth over the centuries in different parts of the land.also read  hindutva rise must be pinned on historians who told us hindus  muslims lived peacefully oncethe rss  controlif today  seven decades later  india s bloodstream shows angrier and less tolerant platelets  much of the blame doubtless falls on the congress and other secular parties. but the story is not as simple as that. credit  or responsibility  should also be assigned to the assiduous work for    continuous years of the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh  rss   whose members would call these platelets virile rather than virulent  and to the toxic nationwide campaigns for demolishing the babri masjid and installing a ram mandir in ayodhya.in more recent years  the success of the bharatiya janata party  bjp  and the spread of the hindu nationalist ideology has also been aided by the skills and stamina of men such as narendra modi and amit shah  by a flow of massive funds to the bjp  and by the sangh s mounting influence  if not control  in tv channels  social media  and institutions of the state.i accept that parts of the rss have drawn upon the social reformist tradition within hinduism. i agree that its exclusion of muslims has been successfully complemented by a campaign to include lower caste hindus. but let us recognise that steady pressure on public opinion from proponents of the secular ideology compelled the sangh parivar s reluctant deference to social reform and its eventual readiness to accord a few influential positions to lower caste hindus.we can welcome these tardy steps while renewing our opposition to the two nation ideology. if the sangh parivar can now move radically forward in its thinking  embrace muslims as equal partners in building india s future  and jettison the two nation theory  that would be a welcome culmination as the rss approaches its centenary.such a climax is unlikely. as is true of muslim nationalist movements in countries such as egypt  iran and turkey  and as was true for the pakistan demand  india s hindu nationalist campaign needs the  enemy other .also read  what gandhi thought of muslims and why that makes him our contemporaryindia s secularism withheld majoriatian risei don t know whether abhay dubey s book examines the global rise of the belief that a particular race or religion owns a nation  and that others must accept a junior status. but it is not hard to see that the sangh parivar s vision of a hindu india coincides with recep tayyip erdogan s picture of an islamic turkey  where the historic hagia sophia has now been decreed to become a mosque   with the banned muslim brotherhood s view of a sunni muslim egypt  with the vision of iran s ayatollahs of a pure  shiite iran  and with the dream of a white america passionately nursed by sections in the us under donald trump.for all their mistakes and failures  india s advocates of secularism are not the chief architects of the sangh parivar s rise. in fact  but for some of these champions  that rise would have come about much earlier. jawaharlal nehru was seeing into the future  not appeasing a minority  when in      he declared that the  communalism of the majority is far more dangerous than the communalism of the minority    because  as nehru added  it  wears the garb of nationalism.  his assessment has been confirmed in india  turkey and elsewhere.any discussion of the rise in india of hindu nationalism must frankly acknowledge two crucial weaknesses on the secular side. one has been the letting down of dalits and adivasis. the partnership when ambedkar worked with nehru  patel and company to produce our constitution of equality  was not reproduced in india s villages  in our cities  crammed bastis  or in our forest lands.all of us know that the contemporary lynching of muslims was preceded by  and is today accompanied by  the lynching of dalits and the uprooting of adivasis. the claim of  a nation for all  becomes a mere taunt when the cries of victims go unheard.great leaders bringing their egos to the battlefront  or to a leadership team  has been a second crucial weakness. after the emergency  morarji desai  charan singh and jagjivan ram were unable to stick together even for two years. in          it took less than a year for v.p. singh  devi lal and chandra shekhar to split up. more recently  congress leaders in madhya pradesh fell out  and now there is the sachin pilot eruption in rajasthan.also read  legal autocrats are on the rise. they use

 and trudge  and put on masks so that they and others may live  don t ask for perfection. the ability to rein in personal ambitions  which is easier said than done  and stick it out is enough for them.abhay dubey is right to say that most critics of the sangh parivar do not look straightforwardly at it. all hindu nationalists are not identical. nor are they personally flawed  except in the sense that all humans have shortcomings.what should be my attitude to them  i unreservedly reject their doctrine that hindus must rule over or absorb muslims  christians  sikhs and other non hindus. but as fellow humans and fellow indians  members of the sangh parivar are entitled to my attention and goodwill.those who believe in equality and in an india for all  also have my goodwill. in their case i would  in addition  endorse their ideology. i would not focus on their human imperfections. as long as they stand up to exclusion  disdain and hate  as long as they oppose ideologies of domination and hierarchy  they are my partners. they may belong to a political party  a caste  a religion  a tribe  or a state different from mine  but if they subscribe to liberty  equality and fraternity  they have my solidarity.if enough of india s countless lovers of liberty  equality and fraternity stick together  refusing to waste energy in the blame game  not only secular ideology but

no votes  ineffective gandhis   larger malaise underlying congress  gehlot pilot spat
text size  a  a new delhi  what transpires between rajasthan chief minister ashok gehlot and deputy chief minister sachin pilot today is symptomatic of a larger malaise within the congress party  said theprint s editor in chief shekhar gupta in episode     of  cut the clutter . in the last two decades or so  what has changed within the congress party is also what has remained the same   said gupta.what has changed most of all is the strength of the dynasty that rules the congress party  that is the strength of the gandhi family. they simply cannot get votes for their party men and women to get elected anymore. in fact  they struggle to get votes for themselves.in the      elections  then party president rahul gandhi lost his amethi seat by a sizeable number of votes. so the ability of the gandhi family now to get votes for their own is gone.that s a big disadvantage in politics and yet what hasn t changed is their control over the party  which is probably the strongest ever in the history of the congress.india s first prime minister jawaharlal nehru had people who rebelled against him and who challenged him in the cabinet. former prime minister indira gandhi  too  had rebellions within her system.however  the congress of today has no such problem.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowthis is the basic contradiction of the party.also read  sachin pilot s anger is misplaced. ashok gehlot isn t the enemy  congress culture issustaining congress  fundamental contradictionthis has happened because of the way the congress party is constructed   it does not have a strong ideology binding people. most of the leaders in the congress party inherited their positions such as sachin pilot  milind deora  jitin prasada  and now bjp member jyotiraditya scindia.while they may swear by their ideological commitment   that only comes later. they want power.now  once you are there for power  then one thing you worry about is that one of your peers will reach the top. so then you get the  crabs in the pitcher  syndrome  which means if any crab is climbing up  other crabs will pull it down.on the other hand  if you have somebody from the dynasty  who you know is entitled to rule the party but at the same time they don t threaten you because you are not in competition with him or her  then you accept their dominance. in this sense  the gandhis don t threaten anybody.this is also why whenever you have a p.v. narasimha rao or sita ram kesari and they give you instructions  nobody follows them.however  when the gandhi s do some such thing  everybody falls in line because they are the leaders by default. so that is how this contradiction is sustained.also read  bjp is sceptical about sachin pilot s numbers  says it s ready to play a  test match rise of smaller  more effective dynastiesin many regions across the country  new dynasties have come up and have essentially taken away the congress party s vote  which has now become the  c team  in these states. the latest example of this was maharashtra where even the national congress party  ncp  went ahead of the congress.other dynasties in different parts of the country include the abdullahs in kashmir  badals in punjab  chauatalas and the bansi lal dynasty in haryana  chandra babu naidu s dynasty in andhra pradesh and the ysr jagan mohan reddy dynasty in the same state  kcr ktr dynasty in telangana

meghalaya   among many others.while the congress party is ruled by a dynasty that cannot get votes  there are       other mini dynasties whose leaders can build both vote banks and keep them together.so the congress party suffers both ways and this is the reason why its in such a big mess.even within the congress party  many dynasties have come up  for instance the amarinder singh dynasty in punjab  the hoodas and the surjewalas in haryana  and the dikshits in delhi  among others.this points towards a greater problem in the congress. they still think they are leaders but most of them

sachin pilot s anger is misplaced. ashok gehlot isn t the enemy  congress culture is
text size  a  a sachin pilot has finally declared war on the congress. this was long waiting to happen  ever since the congress top command chose veteran leader ashok gehlot over him as rajasthan chief minister after the december      assembly election. pilot made no bones about his resentment or of being short changed. since then  he has done precious little to cement his position as a politician or administrator  sulking all the time  targeting gehlot and turning into a rebel without a cause.sachin pilot should have left the congress long ago   for his long term political growth    not because of his rivalry with gehlot  but because of the top leadership of the congress which is selfish  directionless  insecure and over controlling.also read  rahul gandhi to launch video series

conviction  rare in a party where everybody competes to display their loyalties to the gandhis. pilot s revolt should have been for principles  and not for power.sachin pilot   a second generation  committed congress leader who is a dynast  but has not taken his entitlement for granted   had all that it takes to set an example. unfortunately  the young leader ended up squandering that chance

biggest detractors would deny how hard he had worked in rajasthan  shifting his base to the state and nurturing the party there. jolted by his own electoral loss in       pilot took nothing for granted  turning into every bit the rooted  committed politician he is today.given his hardwork and relentless statewide campaign ahead of the      assembly election  it was only natural for pilot to feel disappointed when gehlot was made the cm. the problem  however  is how he allowed himself to get completely consumed by the turf war with gehlot.also read  bjp is sceptical about sachin pilot s

organisation in rajasthan. he was not an unlikely  or questionable choice as the cm. however  the congress  especially then party president rahul gandhi  could have taken a leap of faith and chosen youth and energy over age and experience. many  in fact  felt the decision was unfair to pilot.but once the call was taken and a beaming sachin pilot stood next to rahul gandhi and gehlot to show all was well  the rajasthan deputy cm s trajectory could have been different. sachin hasn t really been able to damage gehlot  neither politically nor in terms of his image. to bolster his slim majority  gehlot won over six mlas from the bahujan samaj party  further strengthening himself politically. administratively  the death of kids at a kota hospital did dent his image  but his seemingly competent handling of the covid crisis has made up for any other lapses in his    month old government. of course  gehlot has played every bit the cussed leader too  cornering pilot time and again and barely giving him any breathing space.but  what does sachin pilot has to show for himself  except for stepped up intra party bickering  he hasn t shone as an administrator or done much to further strengthen his political base.given the immediate trigger of pilot s revolt is the notice that has also been sent to the chief minister and others by the rajasthan police s special operation group in connection with the arrest of two bjp leaders for their alleged attempt to bring down the gehlot government  the desert drama only resembles a family soap opera.the rot in the congress starts from the top  and runs deep  and that is what sachin pilot should have rebelled against. pilot should have quit the congress because there is no real future for young  capable leaders as long as the gandhi family feels threatened by them. pilot should have moved on because the party s leadership cannot ensure electoral wins and does not quite care till it continues to call the shots. he should have found a new home for himself because everybody  including the congress  voter  feels irked by the self absorbed  crabs in a barrel culture of the party.whatever trajectory his political career takes henceforth   given his capabilities and hardwork this is likely to be an upward one   sachin pilot has lost that one golden chance of making a bold  much needed statement.views are personal.subscribe to our channels on

congress is not anti obc. one rajiv gandhi speech is used to cancel out all pro quota steps
text size  a  a the congress  politics of late has put special emphasis on the other backward classes. when the party won the assembly elections in madhya pradesh  rajasthan and chhattisgarh in december       it appointed two chief ministers from the obc category   ashok gehlot in rajasthan  and bhupesh baghel in chhattisgarh. congress  general secretary priyanka gandhi vadra has become dependent on obcs in uttar pradesh s politics. in her state team of one party president and five vice presidents  two belong to the backward classes and one to a scheduled caste. meanwhile  congress president sonia gandhi wrote a letter to prime minister narendra modi  stating that the obc category is not being given the benefit of reservation under all india quota for the national eligibility cum entrance test.historically  the congress has been considered to be against reservations for backward classes. rajiv gandhi s lok sabha speech in september       in which he opposed the mandal commission s report  has been referred to time and again in this context.considering this  it is important to understand whether the congress has been actually against backward classes or reservations. that the congress has not been opposed to obcs and reservation for them can be inferred from the following arguments.constitutional amendment for reservationthe first amendment to the constitution of india came in     . in tamil nadu  there were some court judgments that held reservations as against article       of the constitution  which accords every citizen the right to equality. the courts also cited article        which states that no citizen can be denied admission in any educational institution on the basis of religion  caste  community  or language. it was argued that granting reservation was against the rights granted to minorities under article    of the constitution.india s first prime minister jawaharlal nehru introduced the first amendment and dispelled this confusion. article        was appended to the fundamental rights  in which it was clarified that this article or article        did not go against the provisions made for the benefit of socially and educationally backward classes  scheduled castes and scheduled tribes. nehru s statement in parliament on    may      illustrates this.it should also not be forgotten that the constituent assembly  which had introduced the system of reservation into the constitution  had the largest number of congress members.also read  rss in       sc in        quota row hits bihar polls again but

backward classes commission  constituted under the chairmanship of journalist and social reformer kaka kalelkar. according to article     of the constitution  the kaka kalelkar commission was formed on    january     . the commission presented its report on    march     .discussions about the report went on for six years  until it was rejected in     . in reality  the kaka kalelkar commission had only one member of the backward classes commission   barrister shivdayal singh chaurasia  who wrote an    page note of dissent. the upper caste members of the commission wanted to select other backward classes on the basis of their economic condition.chaurasia believed that since discrimination had been perpetrated on the grounds of caste  the identity of backward classes should also be established on the basis of caste. there was so much controversy over the report that kalelkar wrote a script that led to the suspicion he was not in favour of the implementation of the report.after that  jawaharlal nehru decided that state governments should identify backward classes at their level  and give them appropriate facilities to bring them into the mainstream. not long after  in       nehru passed away. so  it cannot be said that nehru was not a supporter of obc reservation. it was based on the constitutional amendment made in      that states implemented obc reservation  and the mandal commission report was implemented at the centre.also read  how modi shah s bjp is becoming a victim of their obc reservation plotmandal commission and indira gandhiafter the emergency  the

mandal. by the time the commission could prepare its report  the janata party government had collapsed.election was held and the congress came back to power  with indira gandhi as prime minister. she neither dissolved the commission nor obstructed their work. in fact  during indira gandhi s term  the tenure of the commission was extended twice   once from april   to    september       and again from october   to    december     . the commission submitted its report to congress leader and home minister giani zail singh on    december.b.p. mandal expressed gratitude towards indira gandhi while submitting the report. there was no debate on the report. it cannot be denied that indira gandhi managed to get the report prepared during her term in office. however  it is also true that the report could not be implemented during her tenure  or during rajiv gandhi s tenure.also read  eye on bihar polls  modi govt moves to hike obc creamy layer income ceiling to rs    lakhimplementing the mandal

promise  the national front government led by vishwanath pratap singh implemented the recommendations of the mandal commission. this was debated in parliament.rajiv gandhi  as the leader of the opposition  opposed the implementation of the report. he alleged that there were several factual flaws  and called the report incomplete. however  this had little impact. all the leaders of the congress who belonged to backward classes  including sitaram kesri  hailed the implementation of the mandal commission report outside parliament. the case went to the supreme court. election was held in      and the congress formed the government under the leadership of p.v. narasimha rao.the government appealed before the supreme court  which ruled in favour of reservations on    november     . the congress government issued a notification on   september      regarding the implementation of the report. the delay was caused by the time taken to set the parameters for the identification of the creamy layer  which the court had decided to exclude from the obc reservation.those standards were flexible till now. but the narendra modi government is preparing to change this  such that a large section of obcs can only get jobs on the basis of their economic conditions  while giving    per cent reservation to upper castes.also read  reservation not a fundamental right  sc on plea for obc

central educational institutions.following a court case  the law eventually came into force  paving way for the admission of oppressed groups in all well known universities of the country  including the indian institute of technology  iit   indian institute of management  iim   all india institute of medical sciences  aiims  and jawaharlal nehru university  jnu . the congress had to face a lot of opposition during this period  and its credibility among the middle class also took a hit.also read  fear of quota claims   need to save secular state    why caste never made it to the censusreservation in the private sectorwith the opening up of the economy and the introduction of privatisation  many jobs were being created in the private sector. during manmohan singh s tenure as prime minister  the demand for reservation in the private sector arose. at the annual meeting of the confederation of indian industry  cii  in       singh said if the industrial sector did not take ambitious  affirmative strides towards the betterment of the deprived sections  he would be forced to introduce reservation in jobs in the private sector.a task force was then constituted  under the chairmanship of jamshed j. irani  which submitted a report stating that the private sector would promise representation to people from sc and st communities at all levels. it said that large scale companies would support a person from sc st communities every year  so that hundreds of new entrepreneurs could be created.  mandal commission this was the first important step towards providing reservations to the backward classes in the private sector undertaken during congress rule.the pace at which rights were granted to the underprivileged has indeed been very slow under congress governments. however  it would be wrong to say that nothing was done for sc  st  and obc communities. the congress  like many other parties  is not an obc party. it is an all inclusive party. whatever

modi shah aping divide and rule of congress. same fate awaits bjp
text size  a  a there isn t much the narendra modi amit shah led bharatiya janata party needs to learn from the congress in its current avatar  given it has raced past its rival  both politically and electorally  and it also enjoys a clear lead in the perception battle. however  modi and shah seem to have picked up one big lesson from the congress  playbook   the divide and rule policy.the factionalism and infighting in many bjp state units   from karnataka to madhya pradesh to assam    subtle or otherwise  continues unabated  and the party s top two seem happy to allow these rivalries to simmer. this has been an old congress trick   the top leadership  read the gandhis  likes to keep the leaders under them at loggerheads with each other  thus  rendering them dependent on the blessings of the family  making sure nobody poses a challenge to them while they cement their own position.modi and shah have chosen the same strategy. they are way too powerful and much in control of the party to not be able to quell internal bickering and read the riot act to the warring factions. if internal frictions persist  it isn t despite the powerful two  but it is because of them.modi shah duo  however  forgets  or choose to ignore the big lesson   this strategy yields short term gains but hurts in the long run. congress  freefall can be attributed to this approach  which may have helped the gandhi family rule luxuriously  but also ensured a worrying degree of decimation of the party.also read  bjp didn t acquire scindia just for power. it s also to keep shivraj singh chouhan in checkfrom madhya pradeshthe bjp is well ensconced in power at the centre  with modi s popularity continuing to soar and shah s election brain helping the party reap electoral dividends. and yet  their insecurity of power is such that they are more than pleased to preside over a host of internal battles.look at madhya pradesh. it was a state the bjp lost in      by a whisker  but its top leader shivraj singh chouhan continues to remain popular there  and the party even swept the      lok sabha election. the bjp s central command  however  decided to jump at the opportunity of bringing in a sulking jyotiraditya scindia from the congress amid much fanfare  well aware how it would translate into an uneasy relationship between him and chouhan. months later  chouhan was shown his place  scindia was given what he wanted and modi shah ensured they added a generous dose of fuel to this fire of rivalry. the central leadership could have dealt with this delicate issue more sensitively  and ensured that neither side had a reason to complain   easier said than done  but not impossible for two men who take pride in their ability to control the narrative.we are deeply grateful to our

nowessentially  in a state where the bjp had no big internal fights  narendra modi and amit shah decided to go ahead and introduce one.also read  bjp isn t just a machine to win elections  it stands for seva  pm modi to party workers to assamin assam   a newly acquired territory for the bjp   the rivalry between chief minister sarbanada sonowal and congress import and senior minister himanta biswa sarma is anything but a secret. sarma  since he joined the party in       has quickly risen up the bjp ranks and become its chief troubleshooter not just in assam  but all the northeast. in assam  he constantly overshadows sonowal  deals regularly and directly with the party s top leadership and ensures he is the face of all crisis resolution   from anti caa protests to covid.modi shah have allowed this friction to continue right under their watch.also read  madhya pradesh s new cabinet shows that a slow  congressisation  of the bjp is happeningkarnataka and beyondkarnataka  another bjp ruled state that amit shah went to all lengths to snatch back from the congress despite losing the      assembly election  has its own story of factionalism. there have been constant tussles between the old and new guard in the state unit   the latter comprising the defectors from the congress and the janata dal  secular  who shifted their allegiance to the bjp to bag ministerial berths while the former belonging to the cm s camp. the factionalism in karnataka came out in the open when a group of leaders complained to the central leadership about how chief minister b.s. yediyurappa was taking  unilateral  decisions.narendra modi and amit shah have allowed this bitterness to fester  and have even tried to weigh the powerful cm down through various tactics  the latest being the decision to overrule his candidates suggestion for the rajya sabha polls.in gujarat  the vijay rupani nitin patel rivalry is now old news. and in rajasthan  the internal factionalism ahead of the december      assembly election was for all to see.also read  unlike indira gandhi  this is why modi era isn t producing strong new foesthe dangerous strategyfor modi shah  this is a dangerous path to tread. congress  divide and rule history has shown how allowing factionalism to prosper for the sake of limited  parochial gains can go on to damage the organisation at a later stage.the infighting has ended up weakening the congress in many states   haryana  hoodas versus ashok tanwar   madhya pradesh  kamal nath digvijaya singh jyotiraditya scindia axis   assam  the gogois versus himanta battle which led the latter to quit party  and rajasthan  the ashok gehlot sachin pilot fight that has potential to hurt it even in a state it rules .for modi and shah  it may serve them the same temporary purpose   of ensuring there is no challenger. after all  modi himself reached delhi after serving as a state cm for many years  and eventually  displacing all other top leaders  including veteran l. k. advani.but such a strategy makes the organisation vulnerable in the long run  and for anybody wanting to leave behind a legacy of a strong organisation  this can hardly be the plan. by pulling off a congress  narendra modi and amit shah risk becoming the congress.views are personal.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis   only you can fix it you are

the fundamental flaw in priyanka gandhi s uttar pradesh strategy
text size  a  a shaktisinh gohil  congress leader from gujarat  is the party s bihar and delhi state union in charge. rajiv satav of maharashtra is in charge of gujarat. similarly  a. chellakumar of tamil nadu is in charge of the goa unit  and so on.this mechanism makes sure that the central leader in charge of a state has an outsider s view  does not have stakes in the local system  such as aspirations to hold political office in that state   and  as an outsider  is unable to overshadow a leader from that state.this idea goes for a toss when priyanka gandhi becomes the uttar pradesh in charge. she goes a step further and increases our confusion by taking to public campaigning in the state. if one is a voter in uttar pradesh  one is left wondering  who is the party s chief ministerial candidate  priyanka gandhi or state president ajay kumar lallu news of priyanka gandhi moving to lucknow has been appearing and re appearing seasonally like the monsoons. just like priyanka gandhi entered politics after years of speculation  we have now learnt over and over again of sheila kaul s house in lucknow being renovated for the congress state in charge. in a way  the congress way of doing politics is very lakhnavi  cooking a slow dum biryani  while the nawabs play chess.also read  priyanka gandhi to move to lucknow after vacating govt bungalow in delhi  congress leadersdivide and ruleif and when priyanka gandhi does move to lucknow  it will probably be as ceremonial a move as her once in a blue moon visit to the state organised so badly the cameras can t even capture her. the move to lucknow now looks like a best possible reply to the narendra modi government taking away her lodhi estate bungalow. but will priyanka gandhi actually spend more time in uttar pradesh than in delhi  so far she hasn t shown that she s willing to make such a sacrifice on her time with family and friends in delhi.ceremonial or real  priyanka gandhi will definitely spend some time in gokhale marg as the uttar pradesh assembly election come closer. february      is now less than two years away. the harder priyanka gandhi works for it  the more people will wonder if the party s face is gandhi or lallu we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowto be sure  this question will only bother those in uttar pradesh who have some interest in the congress party. and that s not too many people. for all the media hype that priyanka gandhi and yogi adityanath generate by taking on each other  up      is   as of now   largely a yogi vs akhilesh contest  bharatiya janata party vs samajwadi party.this is why the bjp is happy to give attention to priyanka gandhi. it wants to pretend its main competition is the congress  so that the anti bjp vote  especially the muslim vote  remains firmly divided between the samajwadi party  sp   the bahujan samaj party  bsp  and the congress. this will make sure the bjp wins the election even if its vote share comes down due to anti incumbency.yogi versus who in such a situation  if any of the three opposition parties   sp  bsp  congress   want to have even a semblance of a chance at defeating the bjp  they have only one option. a strong presidential style campaign that makes it clear to every voter that the election is about deciding who s better cm material  yogi or akhilesh  yogi or mayawati  yogi or ajay kumar lallu as is obvious  the weakest possibility there is ajay kumar lallu. he s a grassroots leader  but even if he has the potential to become a popular statewide face  the looming shadow of priyanka gandhi won t let him.there is thus no option for priyanka gandhi but to state in as many words that she is the congress party s chief ministerial candidate in uttar pradesh. if she fails to do that  then despite yogi s best efforts to promote her  the congress party will still get fewer seats than the largest bus in rajasthan.by having her communist student leader aide tweet about up in shuddh hindi  she can make media headlines but it doesn t get the congress party any traction in the streets of up. by declaring herself as the cm candidate  priyanka gandhi will send out a strong message to voters in the state that the congress party is serious about up. that is what it will take for up voters to even start thinking about the congress as an option.priyanka gandhi as a declared congress cm candidate  spending at least five days a week in up  will be yogi adityanath s dream come true. he will do his best to make sure the state s political conversation is all about yogi versus priyanka. the bsp and sp will be sidelined to the extent that voters won t be able to tell who the bjp s main opponent is.also read  congress has split into three parties  and not one of them is good at politicsno guts  no glorypriyanka gandhi s hesitation in declaring herself a cm candidate would be the risk. if she fails  the congress  brahmastra  will officially be declared a damp squib. yet if she doesn t declare herself the cm candidate  she s going to fail anyway.the congress party has been winning around    odd seats in the state assembly since       until      when it dipped to  . that is where it is likely to stay with the gandhi or lallu confusion. for all that she s investing in the state  priyanka will then be declared a failure at par with brother rahul. remember  rahul gandhi had also taken it upon himself to  revive  the party in the state when he first joined politics.if priyanka gandhi campaigns as a cm candidate  many might want to give her a chance just out of curiosity. this will

madhya pradesh s new cabinet shows that a slow  congressisation  of the bjp is happening
text size  a  a new delhi  the newly formed madhya pradesh cabinet signals the  congressisation  of the bjp  theprint s editor in chief shekhar gupta said in episode     of cut the clutter.an analysis of the cabinet  and where the loyalty of its members lie  shows that mp chief minister shivraj singh chouhan has been cut to size. in fact  he has been rendered a lame duck who s also been kneecapped.fourteen of the    cabinet members are former congress leader jyotiraditya scindia s loyalists  they had defected to the bjp with scindia back in march. this means more than    per cent of the people  who aren t even members of the house yet  have been made ministers.three others are loyalists of bjp s narottam mishra while three are loyalists of the party s national general secretary kailash vijayvargiya. this leaves just    ministers who are actually cm chouhan s loyalists  which means he has very little space to do or say anything.but it isn t just madhya pradesh which is showing these signs. of the    nda ruled states  bjp has its chief ministers in     but a closer look reveals a slow move towards a complete  congressisation  of the bjp.for one  this indicates the rise of a high command culture in the bjp  just like that of the congress. only one person or a couple of people own that high command space   similar to how the congress is presently run by just a few people  such as rahul gandhi and sonia gandhi.this also shows that the bjp now has very weak cms as well as cabinet ministers. this is because all the power within the party emanates from one source.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowbjp s once formidable cms brigadeone of the main reasons why prime minister narendra modi came to power with such a resounding mandate in      was due to the fact that the bjp had built very strong chief ministers who could always swing elections in their states for him. but six of these strong cms are nowhere to be seen now.former rajasthan cm vasundra raje is out of power as is former chhattisgarh cm raman singh.gujarat had narendra modi as its powerful vote catching cm  but his shift to delhi moved that power with him. in maharashtra  nitin gadkari  who could swing elections single handedly  has now been sidelined.in madhya pradesh  chouhan has also been sidelined  cut to size and rendered powerless despite being the cm.on wednesday  at the swearing in ceremony  he cryptically commented that  amrit  nectar of immortality  comes out of the churning of the ocean as shiva consumes vish  poison    in what may be a metaphorical reference to himself.trend catching onother bjp ruled states signal a similar trend. the formula of keeping your chief minister reduced to a nobody who gets instructions from delhi for anything he wants to do is being repeated in all the states.for instance  assam s cm sarbananda sonowal is seen to have very little power. in fact  it is the health minister himanta biswa sarma who is considered the face of the assam government. he is also seen as the face of the bjp in all of the northeast. he won the northeast for the bjp.in haryana  manohar lal khattar has had to share power with his deputy and jjp leader dushyant singh chuatala  after the two parties were forced to form a coalition government. cabinet minister anil vij too occupies a very important  powerful position in the state government.in gujarat  cm vijay rupani is remote controlled from new delhi  which is a well known fact.manipur cm biren singh was forced to restore the portfolios of his deputy cm  national people s party leader y. joykumar singh  as part of the understanding reached between union home minister amit shah and the npp delegation led by its national president and cm of neighbouring meghalaya  conrad sangma.this means that while singh may be the cm  the real authority and power lies with the high command in delhi.in karnataka  b.s. yediyurappa s authority has been undermined time and again  most recently when none of his rajya sabha nominees were selected by the party high command  which instead backed those of yediyurappa s rival  b.l. santosh.the one exception to this rule is uttar pradesh cm yogi adityanath. he was seen as a political lightweight with no real following of his own. but the fact is that the way adityanath has conducted himself has not only made him more of a hindutva brand ambassador but also a brand ambassador for modi and shah. he wasn t chosen to be an exception  but just turned out to be one.watch the full episode here subscribe to our channels on youtube

unlike indira gandhi  this is why modi era isn t producing strong new foes
text size  a  a arun jaitely  ravi shankar prasad  nitish kumar  lalu yadav  sharad yadav  mulayam singh yadav  ram vilas paswan  sitaram yechury  and prakash karat   all these leaders have one thing in common. their political birth was during the resistance to emergency. if narendra modi s government since      is as draconian as his critics allege  can we name a leader of similar political stature who emerged in the last   years the threat to democracy today is surely no less severe  in fact it s probably more dangerous. in the words of yogendra yadav  our democracy has been  captured  and our first constitutional republic has already ended. yet  you wouldn t know it from the state of our opposition  which is a picture of fecklessness and passivity. what explains this dearth of opposition leadership  particularly the almost complete absence of new leaders  and at a time when we need it the most two big reasons stand out.also read  how bjp has owned the national security issue and why china won t change thatpeople being patient with modiwhen the emergency was declared  indira gandhi was already getting unpopular  eight years into power. the gujarat and bihar agitations against corruption  misgovernance and price rise were going on for nearly two years  signalling widespread sentiment of alienation from the government. many young leaders latched on to this already growing sense of anger that culminated in the jp movement  to launch their political careers. but today  the popular consensus seems to be that modi must be given more time to reverse what he has framed as  sixty years of misgovernance . given the scale of his ambition  to build a  new india   people are willing to give him more leeway  reflected in the scale of his second electoral mandate.second  there was the organisational backing of the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh  rss   which provided an army of resolute cadres that formed the backbone of the anti congress movements. being the only mass national socio political organisation in the country  its footprint can be found in most of the large political mobilisations at the national level  from ayodhya to the anti mandal movement to the anti corruption movement. without organisations  there are no movements  the wellsprings of new political leadership. the opposition today lacks such an organisation.the scale of the opposition failure in leadership merits a deeper analysis. we identify six reasons for this failure  four supply sided  the failure of the political system to produce effective opposition leadership  and two demand sided  there is no popular appetite for energetic opposition leadership .we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowalso read  india s young no longer charmed by modi. blame economy and ideologywhere the opposition couldn t deliverfirst  there are no comparable movements of large groups today acting as a conveyor belt of political talent. the anti citizenship amendment act movement was of limited scope and did not throw up any significant political leader. the four biggest youth leaders to have emerged over the last six years chandrasekhar azad  jignesh mewani  hardik patel and kanhaiya kumar are still confined to narrow pockets of influence  and do not pose a significant challenge to the modi government.second  existing political parties have become sclerotic and undemocratic  making it very difficult for  non dynastic  young political talent to emerge. interestingly  all of the young leaders cited above  except kanhaiya to an extent  have emerged outside of any party structure. there are no strong young leaders such as atal bihari vajpayee or lal krishna advani who came up the ranks of their organisations and resisted the emergency. the congress party hasn t held meaningful internal elections for the top posts since the time of indira gandhi. regional parties formed around caste language lines  rjd  sp  jd  s   dmk  have ossified into single family bastions. the last big movement that birthed a genuinely mass political leader was the india against corruption movement that gave us arvind kejriwal.third  it s difficult for new mass leaders challenging the modi government to emerge from the politicisation of existing cleavages. the bjp has adapted to the three decade old mandal movement by deftly side lining caste cleavages in the political discourse through calculated re engineering of caste affiliations. modi and amit shah have managed to undercut the appeal of opposition obc leaders  like the yadavs  by appealing to non dominant backward castes. they have employed a similar strategy with dalits  pitting dalit sub castes who had been excluded from political and social power against the relatively powerful dalit sub castes like jatavs.in other words  there are no longer any broad cleavages to ground clear and potent political narratives of oppression. an increasingly large number of young members of backward castes are moving away from this narrative of oppression to a narrative of aspiration and hindu unity. there is no fresh  young talent in these tightly controlled family run mandal parties to bring back these sections with a reimagined political narrative. contrast this with the bjp. by side lining the old guard  like advani  kalyan singh  murli manohar joshi   who had depleted their political capital and replacing them with leaders like modi and yogi adityanath  the party has re energised hindutva with the politics of aspirations  welfare and law and order.fourth  it took a leader of the stature of jayaprakash narayan to bring all the ideologically diverse opposition parties under a common platform of  anti  congressism   both in the jp movement and in the resistance to the emergency. jp was widely respected by everyone  and drew his enormous popular legitimacy from the independence struggle as well as having rejected a cabinet berth in the nehru government. there is no one in the present congress leadership  or outside  who has the authority to similarly coalesce the opposition into a united anti bjp platform. sonia gandhi has receded from active politics  and rahul gandhi can hardly be counted upon to seriously lead his own party  let alone a united opposition.also read  covid lockdown has ended only opposition politics in india. bjp s shop is very much openmodi enjoying the legitimacy of popularityapart from these supply side factors explaining the dearth of political leadership  there are certain demand side impediments.first  unlike the emergency  the formal processes of a democracy have been left intact by the modi government  thus preventing the opposition leaders from effectively conveying the seriousness of the situation to a largely indifferent public. for instance  the act of voting  something that is considered sacrosanct and universally accorded a high degree of importance  has not been rescinded. many ordinary citizens might not concretely feel the restriction of abstract freedoms in their everyday lives  as long as they see external processes of democracy regular and competitive elections  campaigning  freedom to vote all running smoothly on the surface.second  the present moment doesn t feel as urgent or alarming simply because the prime minister enjoys a great deal of popular legitimacy. thus  unlike the naked power employed in the emergency  which was seen as coercive and illegitimate  the resounding mandate and popularity of the present government lends a veil of legitimacy to even constitutionally questionable or undemocratic actions of the government. there is no alienation and disaffection of a large segment of the public as was seen in the upsurges of the mid   s. since the modi government enjoys this level of credibility  the public is not looking for new alternative leaders who can act as vehicles for their resentment.for the health of a democracy  the absence of a credible opposition force represents a moment no less alarming than that of the outright suspension of democratic rights. our democracy is not dying from the bludgeon of an emergency  but from the slow poison coursing through its veins.asim ali and ankita barthwal are research associates at the centre for policy research  new delhi. views are personal.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis

no cure yet for covid  or congress crisis. rahul gandhi continuously fails to win india
text size  a  a the congress conundrum is quite similar to the coronavirus crisis   both thrive on varied reasons and symptoms. just as there is no single medicine to cure covid     there is no one answer that addresses  let alone resolves  the congress conundrum. in the absence of any vaccine  social distancing has come to be a universally acceptable precaution against covid   . similarly  the need for a strong central leadership for the congress looks like the only possible shot at rebuilding the party. and just like only god knows when the pandemic might end  it is again only bhagwan who can tell us when the congress would become relevant again.not just routine loss of powerin a democratic polity  no party can remain in power forever  hence it is routine for them to win and lose elections. so  this cannot be the real reason for the current congress crisis. the bhartiya janata party  bjp   after being in power between      and       remained out of power for ten years          . yet  it was able to circumvent the sort of crises the congress is facing today. the grand old party  though  is unique in that it has faced large scale desertions even when in power with thumping majorities.in terms of ideology  it is reasonable to say that there has hardly been any change in the congress party s  official  ideology. clearly  the crisis within the congress cannot be ascribed to this. loose or strong  the ideological bonding of congress leaders has been historically consistent. indian voters may have some unease about the party s ideological leanings  but its leaders don t usually have to deal with such tensions.also read  bjp trying to topple my govt  history won t forgive this   ashok gehlot writes to pm modifactors determining congress crisisthere are three plausible and interrelated factors that could allude to the present crisis within the congress   feeble central leadership  generational divide  and the ambitious rants of the younger lot.let s look at the issue of the ambitious younger generation   is it wrong to be ambitious in politics  certainly not  because in the world we live in  politics is hardly a social service. instead  it is  in the weberian sense  a vocation  a lucrative career opportunity. political parties are said to be organised bodies with voluntary membership  which are in pursuit of political power. the ambition of their members is to capture top party positions and hold on to them for as long as they could.naturally  these features make parties prone to factions  defections  splits  and mergers. hence  parties have to be constantly on guard  and to be fair  the congress does have a record of successfully accomplishing that feat. recall the developments in                   and        when several congress leaders deserted the party to join other groups or formed their own organisations. most of those crises  however  were resolved only because of the congress  strong central leadership. any party facing an existential crisis is able to rebound   much to the chagrin of columnists writing obituaries of that party   only due to the effective leadership at the helm of its affairs. the bjp is an exemplar of such an argument  seemingly more focused on this count than the congress.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowthis brings us to the most crucial factor regarding the congress  weak central leadership. findings of the survey conducted by lokniti csds between      and      indicate that while the popularity of prime minister narendra modi has been rising over the years  in relative terms  rahul gandhi s appeal has been on a steady wane. in the beginning of       modi was the choice of only    per cent indians for the pm s post  while rahul gandhi was preferred by    per cent of the population. but by       modi s popularity went up to    per cent  while gandhi s declined to    per cent. even when jobless labourers were facing an existential crisis across the country due to the sudden announcement of covid    lockdown  evidence suggests that modi s popularity hardly declined. and in spite of rahul gandhi s efforts  people did not recognise him as a promising leader. clearly  the congress has its tasks cut out.also read  congress       style treatment of young leaders won t work. it can learn from bjpwidening generational dividesuch weak central leadership then provides an opportunity for the emergence of generational divide between the elder and younger leaders  where the former stake their claim on experience  while the later demand their pound of flesh on dynamisms. unfortunately  the congress  top leadership also seems torn between these two choices. the latest crisis in its rajasthan unit has only strengthened this divide. in conjunction  these factors pose insurmountable challenges to what was once the  predominant party  in india s political landscape  primarily on account of its accommodative spirit.factions causing some kind of crisis are inherent in party politics and can be seen as normal. in some political parties it is more than normal  while in others it could be uncommon or subdued. the issue is about managing these factions or growing sections of dissent  and that depends a lot on its leaders  their crises management abilities and their style of functioning.but the severity  span and the range of crises that the congress party faces appears despairingly interminable. however  if the democratic spirit is about choices and alternatives  then a reawakened and assertive congress is a necessity for the resilient operation of india s parliamentary democracy. the way ahead  though  will be shaped by how the party s top leadership responds to the many challenges. will it take them head on  or see them through as just another

in rahul gandhi  jaishankar picks an easy target. modi govt s real task is to push china back
text size  a  a congress leader rahul gandhi shed the politician s uniform  the white kurta pyjama  for a light blue boardroom shirt in two beautifully   and expensively   shot videos over the last week  as he attempted to pin the narendra modi government down on its foreign policy mistakes  especially on china.in the first video released on    july  gandhi asked  why has china chosen this particular time to violate the line of actual control  lac  in ladakh since       the pm s constant blunders and indiscretions have fundamentally weakened india and left us vulnerable. empty words don t suffice in the world of geopolitics. pic.twitter.com xm pxcrufh   rahul gandhi   rahulgandhi  july         in the second video  posted on    july  gandhi pointed out that the chinese don t do anything without thinking about strategy  so what s their tactical and strategic game plan pm fabricated a fake strongman image to come to power. it was his biggest strength. it is now india s biggest weakness. pic.twitter.com ifaplkfpvv   rahul gandhi   rahulgandhi  july         perhaps the question to be asked here is how rahul gandhi found the time to make these china videos   notice the care with which they have been shot  the ombre merging into a dark background  the post production work showing up his tanned lines   but hasn t said a word in defence of his former friend and colleague  sachin pilot  who has been roundly humiliated by senior congress leader ashok gehlot these last few days.clearly  rahul gandhi would rather speak of the enemy at the gates in ladakh instead of addressing the enemy within. a leader who cannot protect his own  who would stand by and allow the older generation to eat their young  how can he protect india when it is in trouble   never mind that the congress party is thrilled that their dear leader s second china video has been trending on twitter all morning in response to rahul s first video  external affairs minister s. jaishankar let fly a storm of    tweets. unlike gandhi  jaishankar certainly doesn t want to be prime minister   he knows he has unprecedented power already. but loyalty to the pm demanded that he respond to the congress leader  even if it meant unfairly targeting the previous government that did not fall because of foreign policy miscalculations   and even if the attack on the past showed up his own ministry in bad light.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowso let s analyse five of jaishankar s responses to rahul gandhi  . sj  india engages with china on more equal terms politically.it is true that pm modi has met china s top leader  president xi jinping  more times than any previous leader  which is a good thing. but modi s team is certainly emboldened by soldiers such as    year old gurtej singh and several others  who displayed incredible courage on    june night on the frigid heights of the galwan valley  when they killed several chinese soldiers  including their commanding officer.the point here is that in dealing with the chinese  jaishankar should know that the moral high ground belongs to india  and not just pm modi.also read  balancing lac tension with economic strategy   how india can walk the tightrope against china . sj  we speak our mind more openly now ask the media. we speak our mind more openly now. on  cpec  on  bri  on south china sea  on un sanctioned terrorists  etc. ask the media.   dr. s. jaishankar   drsjaishankar  july         being a former diplomat  jaishankar understands dissent. he has dealt with journalists and tried to win them over because he knew it was important in order to spread india s message. but as eam  he presides over a ministry that would rather speak to journalists who agree with him.  don t call us  we ll call you   is his ministry s message. . sj  address the border infrastructure legacy  ask our jawans.  and address the  border infrastructure imbalance legacy. compare         with        . budget up by       road building by      bridges by     and tunnels by   times. ask our jawans.   dr. s. jaishankar   drsjaishankar  july         in this school of thought  the building of india can only be compared in six year blocks  because modi has completed   years in power. it doesn t matter that manmohan singh was pm from            during which period the china study group first proposed that border infrastructure should be vastly improved. to its credit  modi has carried that idea forward  as he should have.but what if jaishankar were to also look up the previous six year period  when atal bihari vajpayee was pm and under whom the special representative mechanism with china was set up  he will find that infrastructure along the border with china was either non existent or abysmal.also read  modi s underrated strategy of neutralising criticism helps him retain the teflon coating . sj  nepal after    years is getting  a swathe of developmental projects. ask their citizens.  nepal after    years is getting prime ministerial visits. and a swathe of developmental projects  power  fuel  housing  hospital  roads  etc. ask their citizens.   dr. s. jaishankar   drsjaishankar  july         someone badly messed up on this tweet. in       the modi government decided to support the madhesi agitation  in       the ministry of external affairs failed to understand the anti india politics of communist leader k.p. oli  and in       nepal is releasing new maps claiming disputed territory as its own. from      onwards  india s nepal policy has gone only in one direction  southward. . sj  and pakistan notes the difference between balakot   uri on the one hand and sharm el sheikh  havana         on the other ask yourself. and  pakistan  that you skipped  surely notes the difference between balakot   uri on the one hand  and sharm el sheikh  havana         on the other. ask yourself.   dr. s. jaishankar   drsjaishankar  july         one wonders what jaishankar would have said about vajpayee s lahore bus ride in       the ic     hijacking that saw the vajpayee government give up three terrorists  and then  only two years later  invite pervez musharraf  the author of the kargil conflict  to peace talks in agra  and when all those measures failed  vajpayee didn t give up but set up another summit in january      with musharraf in pakistan so  the question is  should jaishankar resist the temptation to score political points off an opposition leader   rahul gandhi  in this case   who doesn t really know better  surely  the good eam knows that there are several people with longer memories and better understanding of context rahul gandhi is an easy target. the tough work will come when the modi government will have to use all its persuasive power as well as its friendships with powerful nations like the us and russia to get china to fully withdraw on its own side of the lac.one last question  who sanctioned pm modi s talking points at the    june all party meeting on the chinese intrusion in ladakh  when the pm said  no one had intruded into indian territory or taken any post   everything the government has done subsequently is to tiptoe around that statement and walk back the chinese on the ground. can someone in the mea explain that one  please views are personal.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis   only you can fix it you are

why exactly is rahul gandhi going on mansarovar yatra at peak of madhya pradesh campaign 
text size  a  a while madhya pradesh chief minister shivraj singh chouhan s yatra is in its last leg  congress hasn t launched its campaign yet.rahul gandhi s kailash mansarovar yatra may be a spiritual highpoint in his life. but the congress president s two week long absence from poll bound states of madhya pradesh  rajasthan and chhattisgarh has made some of his partymen little edgy.in madhya pradesh  for instance  congressmen in private conversations ask why rahul could not show his shiv bhakti  devotion to lord shiva  closer home in ujjain that houses the mahakal temple.the prehistoric shiva lingam at the ujjain mahakal temple is believed to be a swayambhu  born of itself  and is considered one of the    jyotirlingas in india.after all  bjp national president amit shah had launched the party s election campaign for madhya pradesh polls  scheduled for november  from the mahakal temple on    july and flagged off chief minister shivraj singh chouhan s    day long jan ashirwad yatra.also read  shivraj singh chouhan is channeling his inner narendra modi in his penchant for yatraschouhan s yatra is now in its last leg but the congress is yet to formally launch its poll campaign. the party says that once rahul returns from the kailash mansarovar yatra  he will visit state capital bhopal on    september.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowin the absence of any concrete programme against the chouhan regime in madhya pradesh  the congress is unable to formally channelise the anger on the ground against the bjp. and  it is manifesting itself in stray incidents of violence.in two separate instances sunday  a slipper and stones were hurled at chouhan in sidhi district  prompting the chief minister to accuse the congress of being  thirsty for his blood .all this while a volvo bus  which was used during the karnataka election to ferry leaders of various factions of the state congress together as a show of unity  is being parked at mpcc chief kamal nath s   shyamla hills residence in bhopal since july. the same bus could see rivals nath  digvijaya singh and jyotiraditya scindia travel together. but  rahul has not found the time to flag it off.there is a lot of work that needs to be done beyond flagging off the bus. the party needs to finalise alliances with smaller but significant players like the bahujan samaj party  bsp  and the gondwana gantantra party  ggp  in the state.in addition  resource mobilisation  coordination  identification of talking points  candidate selection process  social media campaigns need to be thrashed out. anyone faintly connected with the congress style of functioning knows that in each of these areas  intervention or clearance from the top  read rahul  is a pre requisite.but rahul s pilgrimage to mansarovar is also embedded with political symbolism   an effort at course correction seen since the gujarat election campaign.also read  did the congress benefit from rahul gandhi s temple tourism  here s what the data showsit is also perhaps the first time in the post independence history of the congress that a party president has undertaken such a long spiritual journey. while jawaharlal nehru had scant regard and little patience with rituals  indira gandhi restricted herself to visiting prominent temples and places of worship  a practice that both rajiv and sonia gandhi followed.rahul s kailash mansarovar yatra seems both spiritual and political. he may have a strong craving to discover his inner self  but a detached assessment tells a political story too.after all  since the advent of sonia in          the issue of her faith has been a political subject. her critics have said that sonia s bid to identify herself with hinduism has much to do with the political compulsions of the time.but the pressure on sonia to profess a particular faith did not come from the hindu right alone. during      general elections when the sangh parivar launched a  ram rajya  versus  rome rajya  campaign  on grounds of sonia s italian origins   the roman catholic association in india took a rather unprecedented step of denying that sonia was a practicing catholic.  page      sonia  a biography  penguin      .the question of her faith continued to hound sonia. in january       sonia took a holy dip at the allahabad kumbh when the temperature was barely    degrees celsius. acting on the advice and guidance from family retainers like m.l. fotedar and suresh pachouri  sonia had performed ganga puja  kul devta puja  ganpati puja and triveni puja on    january     . in august that year  she had inaugurated ganesh ustav celebrations in pune and performed aarti and puja of lord ganesha.  page          sonia  a biography  penguin      also read  the cardinal rules of politics rahul gandhi needs to learn from young tejashwi yadavfor most indians  both rahul and priyanka gandhi s hindu faith could be obvious or a matter of personal choice. but for politically inclined congressmen  the public display of rahul s hindu identity is important. this was the reason why a janeu dhari hindu image was created by the congress spin doctors and a  temple run  was organised before the gujarat assembly election.some congressmen feel that just as sonia s overt religious acts and identification with the hindu faith had helped blunt the issue of her foreign origins  rahul s kailash mansarovar yatra will bring political dividends too   especially because madhya pradesh  chhattisgarh and rajasthan are known to be deeply religious and conservative states.rasheed kidwai is an orf visiting fellow

sachin pilot s political graph saw a steep rise  before it nosedived between congress and bjp
text size  a  a on an early winter morning in november       sachin pilot arrived at chhan village   part of the tonk assembly segment that he was contesting from in the upcoming rajasthan state election   mounted on top of a mare. an otherwise assertive pilot  always exuding confidence  smiled sheepishly when the women of the village rushed to tie him rakhis.but his next move came almost naturally   pilot went ahead  greeted the village sarpanch and asked him about his kids.  whenever he would visit a village where his father had a connection  he would immediately remind the sarpanch of their time together   said mohammad iqbal  a senior journalist based out of rajasthan who travelled with pilot s convoy in the run up to the      election.pilot  whose father died in a tragic car accident in       was all too aware of his dynast image  and wished to go out of his way to seem like a  grounded politician   and  rajasthan s son . part of this required him to  look and sound  a certain way and carry that well crafted image to ensure his acceptability among the masses.showing off his ability to wear the traditional safa in less than    seconds  and greeting everyone he met on his campaign trail with a  ram ram sa  was in sync with his effort.whatever pilot did  seemed to work like a charm. the congress party came back to power in rajasthan defeating the bharatiya janata party  bjp   although by a slim margin of      . with support of independents and other allies  as well as from the bahujan samaj party  bsp  mlas who joined the party  the congress was able to form the government with     seats in the     member assembly.eighteen months later  pilot  who steered his party to victory  was sacked from the posts of the deputy chief minister as well as the rajasthan congress chief. contrary to all speculations  he insists he has no intention of joining the bjp  even as the congress leadership accuses him of hobnobbing with the party.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowwhere the rajasthan leader would land after boarding his flight of political rebellion is still a guesswork in progress in the political circles  from delhi to jaipur  and this is why sachin pilot is theprint s newsmaker of the week.also read  sachin pilot   co will be   th breakaway from congress. but only    survived on their owndynasty roots and the headstartit s widely been said that while rajasthan chief minister ashok gehlot was busy discharging his responsibilities as the all india congress committee  aicc  general secretary  it was sachin pilot who led the party to victory in the      assembly election. but that was his job as the state party chief  i don t get why people go so overboard in appreciating him for it. he only did what his job was   sandeep dikshit  former congress mp and son of former delhi chief minister sheila dikshit  told theprint.the role of pilot s  dynasty roots  are often underplayed in the analysis of his career trajectory  leaders argue.after rajesh pilot s sudden death in       his wife rama pilot took over as mp of dausa lok sabha seat after winning the byelection. four years later     year old sachin pilot won from the same constituency  becoming the youngest parliamentarian back then. it was also the year he married sara abdullah   daughter of farooq abdullah  former chief minister of jammu and kashmir.  do you think i or sachin pilot or jyotiraditya scindia would have ever won our first elections if we weren t sons of former congress leaders  you can t claim to be an ace runner when you were given a headstart in a race   dikshit said.an mba graduate from wharton school  pilot s close aides say he imbued the party with a  corporate zeal  after being made the rajasthan pradesh congress committee chief in     .but he felt he was given  the raw end of the deal  when he was made the deputy cm in       and purportedly continued to face humiliation thereafter.pilot was reportedly not informed about the six bsp mlas joining the congress. a booklet released by the gehlot government on its achievements skipped any mention of pilot and his ministries. he accepted the post and tried to adjust. but over the last two years  he was choking. he wasn t invited for the important celebrations  he wasn t kept in the loop about major policy decisions   a close aide of pilot said.pilot and    other  rebel  mlas from his camp were served a disqualification notice wednesday over alleged  anti party  activities. the congress has gone on to release audios of alleged conversations between mlas from the pilot camp and bjp leaders planning to topple the gehlot government. investigation will reveal whether this is true. but if pilot does join bjp  it will raise a greater question on just how ideologically weak and unstable congress is  and how flexible its young turks are   said a senior congress leader requesting anonymity.also read  sachin pilot is not himanta biswa. every congress rebel cannot win elections for bjpparallels with scindiain an off the cuff episode from october       pilot can be seen emphatically defending the congress as a party that encourages young talent  and enumerating his umpteen accomplishments. i became mp at    i became minister at     i became party president at     and if i still want more from the party  then i think it s wrong. it s time for me to give back to the party   pilot had said.pilot was sharing the stage with another young scion of the congress   jyotiraditya scindia  who joined the bjp in march this year and toppled the kamal nath government in madhya pradesh by what was nothing short of a coup.in the course of the same discussion  on being asked whether the congress should have a cm face in madhya pradesh and rajasthan before the      assembly elections  pat came scindia s pithy reply  yes.but pilot took his time and gave a much more diplomatic  leader esque response about  taking everyone together   a stance often taken by the congress before an election or after a victory. i don t think it s right for us to have just one  cm  face in rajasthan  we should have      pilot had said.despite the differences between their style and stance  comparisons between scindia and pilot have often been made  mostly clubbing them together as congress  young turks.for dikshit  however  there is one major difference between the two    scindia is insufferably arrogant and pilot is sufferably arrogant. both scindia and pilot were seen as rahul gandhi s  chosen ones    the favourite confidantes. i would see this young lot sitting together in parliament   pilot  scindia  jitin prasada and others  but i had little to do with them   mani shankar aiyar told theprint.soon after  however  aiyar sat up and took notice of pilot when the latter was made the minister of corporate affairs in      under manmohan singh led upa ii.pilot fielded questions from everyone  including then leader of opposition arun jaitley who would go on to succeed the ministry  albeit in a senior role. i saw him pilot the companies act with a total command in the subject and a real eye for detail. his ability to answer on his feet without consulting people around him really impressed me   aiyar said.in a column in the indian express  aiyar has rued over the fact that rahul gandhi is often betrayed by those he loves the most  scindia and now pilot. but it s worth wondering why he gets betrayed like this  why he isn t able to retain confidantes. i think the problem isn t that he chooses  young  people  but that he doesn t choose the right kind of young people. he chooses people whose personal ambitions override the party s   a senior congress leader told theprint on condition of anonymity.sixty nine year old gehlot also snubbed pilot and his perceived image of being a well spoken  delhi media friendly politician.  speaking good english  giving good quotes and being handsome isn t everything. what is in your heart for the country  your ideology  policies and commitment  everything is important   gehlot said earlier this week.former assam chief minister and congress leader tarun gogoi has slammed the young party leaders of the congress  including his son gaurav gogoi  for thinking that chief minister ship is their  birthright . the problem with these young people   even my own son i will say   didn t come from the grassroots. a grassroot leader understands all the challenges and troubles   gogoi said in an interview.congress mp gaurav gogoi said he  wholeheartedly  agrees with the sentiment of his father.also read  sachin pilot has done the unthinkable   united all tv channels from ndtv to republicis ambition a virtue but many other younger leaders of the party argue that  ambition  isn t a quality that should be looked down upon.pradyot manikya deb barman  the former president of the congress in tripura  broke rank from the party last year over differences with the high command  which he said was  not serious in handling young leadership. however  barman did not join the bjp  but went on to form the indigenous progressive regional alliance or tipra  which he describes as the  principal opposition  to the bjp in the state.from sharad pawar in maharashtra to mamata banerjee in west bengal  there is enough precedence for pilot to follow if he wants to form his own party in the state. he shifted base to jaipur  next to the party headquarters after becoming the party president. and even before that  he took part in protests for the gujjar community and faced arrests   saud saidi  former president of the tonk district congress committee  said.saidi says pilot has garnered enough support among the masses   particularly mastering the caste combination. gujjars and meenas are historically seen as rivals here. but if you see the mlas in his camp  it has equal numbers from both communities  which is a great success   saidi said.political analyst and a visiting fellow at policy think tank observer research foundation  rasheed kidwai agrees that pilot would be able to lead a third front   but not until     .  rajasthan has been a two party state. and in today s age the lines are very clear  you are either pro bjp or anti bjp . so even if he does form his third front  he will first have to wait until the next assembly election to do that. but the rebel mlas wouldn t stick along with him for that long. and even after that  he will have to choose his allegiance as an ally to a party   kidwai added.views are personal.subscribe to our channels on youtube

why it s so important for bjp to snatch power in congress ruled states
text size  a  a why is it so important to capture state governments though you did not get the voters  mandate  one answer could be that it helps to have control of the state administration for whenever the next elections are held. police and other officials can be transferred as required to facilitate the ruling party s campaigning  made to look the other way when skulduggery is on  like moving voters  bribe money into a constituency   or deployed to engineer the support of local influencers and toughs.there is a less obvious possibility  much of the money that can be milked from the government system for political use is at state  not central  level. the double benefit is that the same money can be denied to the opposition  which by definition is already at a disadvantage because it does not have access to the funds that control of the central government can help generate. businessmen are usually willing to pay because their life can be made difficult or facilitated by the centre s  agencies   taxmen  bank officials  the infamous  phone banking    and sector regulators who hand out convenient decisions.while such funding is large and important  the fiscal reality as it has evolved puts the bulk of the government money in the hands of the states  not the centre. the latter s total expenditure last year was about rs    lakh crore  but most of that was pre committed. pay and pensions for over one crore employees and pensioners  interest payments on government debt  climbing rapidly   and transfers to the states  more generous than in the past  accounted in more or less equal measure for a combined total of nearly three quarters of the whole. discretionary spending by the centre was  therefore  no more than about rs   lakh crore. against this  the states spent rs    lakh crore  of which pre empted expenditure was much less than for the centre. interest payments  for instance  were less than    per cent of the central bill.also read  health a state subject  but covid proved how dependant india s states are on centreso if there is money to be made out of kickbacks on government payouts  much of the bigger opportunities are in the states. think irrigation and road construction contracts  deals on liquor excise and mining leases  as in karnataka s reddy brothers and the riches of ballari   and purchases of all kinds  power by state discoms  coal by power generating stations  fodder by animal husbandry departments  tendu leaf purchase contracts  the list is long . what is more  there is usually less scrutiny of state level deals  unless you are unlucky like lalu prasad.control of a state government or two is  therefore  crucial for the effective functioning of a party in the wilderness like the congress. one reason why its chief ministers have been so powerful is that it is they who fund the party at the centre. think back to the power wielded by y.s. rajasekhara reddy  and the rapid acquisition of wealth by his son  and bhupinder singh hooda  all those permissions for change of land use   among others.to snatch a state government out of congress hands is therefore a high stakes game with national political implications  for it denies the party the essential fuel to run effective election campaigns. the price of a state legislator who is willing to switch party affiliation may seem large if it stretches  as various accounts have it  from rs    crore to rs    crore. but for bagging    or    legislators and swinging the balance in the assembly  a war chest big enough to hold rs     crore is well worth putting out  if that means denying a rival party the riches of a state exchequer  similar  in historical terms  to bribing mir jaffer to pocket  in due course  the diwani of bengal .what is more  since the congress has little prospect of being anything more than a minor player in some large and medium states  bihar  up  maharashtra  west bengal  tamil nadu  andhra pradesh   control of the bigger ones among the rest like karnataka  madhya pradesh  and rajasthan becomes all the more important for its continuance as an effective force. the obverse is that denying these states to the congress becomes crucial for achieving the declared goal of a  congress mukt  bharat.also read  elections have become meaningless in india   the bjp wins even when it losessubscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media

remember  it was the congress that messed up india s fight against naxals
text size  a  a between congress and its  coterie  they couldn t make up their minds if naxals were a grave threat or merely misguided people fighting for tribals.how do we justify using a bushism as the upa finally displays some clarity of vision in dealing with violent maoists  and a bushism like  you are either with us  or against us.because  so far  for all of these nine ridiculous years  the upa has not been able to decide whether it is with itself  or against itself  on this insurgency in india s east central heartlands. every few months  usually at some high level security conference  the prime minister describes it as the greatest threat to india. then a chidambaram takes the cue and builds a more robust response to the armed insurrection. and both are cut down by a digvijaya singh coming up with his own  root causes  theory.operation green hunt may still be a mythical codename  but the home ministry does launch an audacious campaign to move into the so called  liberated zones   frankly  the most brutal obscenity that this nation has been gifted in this decade of waffling . the forces make some progress  and also suffer some reverses   the    killed in dantewada is by far the highest single day loss for india s security forces in counter insurgency after the first night of operation bluestar      . the third highest of a day has also been in this confused war      when a police boat was attacked on june           in orissa .you need to put these figures in perspective. india s armed forces rarely suffer such high single battle or single operation casualties in counter insurgency. they did not lose these many lives on any one day of fighting even in kargil  even on the nights tololing and tiger hill were assaulted. and how has the upa responded also read  congress criticises arrests of activists   under a law it had introduced   strengthenedit has kept mum as its embedded  liberals  have popped up routinely with conspiracy theories and  root causes . and equally so when successive chiefs of the army and the iaf have made unsolicited statements that their forces can t be used in fighting the naxals  if i may add with some trepidation because i know what militaristic fury this could unleash   with poorly concealed delight that the paramilitary forces were getting their  comeuppance . no chief has been questioned  countered or counselled to also stay out of the debate as much as they want to stay away from action.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowthis is why we say that on the naxal issue  the upa s response would confuse george bush himself. how would his simple  maybe simplistic  and uncluttered mind deal with a situation where a government is against an enemy  but also with it  or  forget poor bush. how would your mind deal with it  and mine for nine years now  the upa and its various elements  ranging from the prime minister to those considered close to sonia and speaking for her  from the home ministers  i use the plural because even the three who ran that ministry  shivraj patil  chidambaram and shinde  spoke in different voices  with the first being a pure root causes man  to nac members spoke at cross purposes. one set called them a grave threat  a bunch of bandits and so on  while the other romanticised them as merely misguided  well meaning people fighting for the tribal victims of  extractive  industries.for a full nine years  the leadership of the congress bought this unquestioningly. it allowed  even welcomed  the embedding of the maoist middle ground and sympathisers within its establishment  notably the nac and the planning commission. remember that one of those eight maoists released in exchange for the abducted malkangiri collector vineel krishna was a. padma  wife of top maoist akkiraju haragopal alias ramakrishna. and she managed aman vedika  an orphanage run by activist and then nac member harsh mander.many of us sympathised with dr binayak sen for being charged and convicted under the obviously archaic sedition law. he is also a very likeable  soft spoken  sincere paediatrician. but must you appoint him in a key planning commission committee  steering committee on health  drafting their   th five year plan  gentle  children s doctor  yes. but he is a convicted maoist sympathiser. bringing him inside the tent like this  what message are you sending out to the security forces  to the police and intelligence agencies and people of india  or  to twist the knife  and twist a popular hindi heartland slogan as well  sainiko tum sangharsh karo  hamein pata nahin hum kiske saath hain  fight on soldiers  just that we are not sure whose side we are on . and finally  what message are you sending out to the maoists  they only let you know last week how they read your confused minds  by wiping out the entire leadership of your party in chhattisgarh  including the veteran vidya charan shukla.this is not the first government to be confused while dealing with an internal security challenge. the one comparable example is v.p. singh sending jagmohan as governor to throttle the then incipient kashmiri insurgency and  at the same time  designating george fernandes as the kashmir affairs minister to apply the healing touch. the two worked at cross purposes  clashed and confused everybody  from the armed forces to the people of kashmir  even the separatists. the price of that schizophrenic approach  we are all still paying. the upa s nine years have given us a bit of this. it was reassuring earlier this week to see the rural development minister speak out on tv channels  finally using the correct and fitting description for the maoists. but the same minister was saying smugly until the other day that maoism only prospered in states not governed by the congress.sadly  politicians are not the only guilty party here. your heads and hearts should burn with fury every time an armed forces chief says he won t send his forces to fight the maoists  because his troops can t be seen fighting their own countrymen. own countrymen  did you say  then who are the kashmiris whom you ve been fighting with pride  and to subdue whom you have built the largest and most powerful military command in india s history  so large that the northern army commander has more than    two  and three star generals reporting to him. so you think kashmiris are not your countrymen as much as the heartland indians are. isn t that exactly what the kashmiri separatists are saying or what about the nagas  the manipuris and other tribal insurrectionists of the northeast  to fight whom  sort of permanently  you have set up an entire counter insurgency corps in dimapur  do you think they aren t indians as much as the tribals of dandakaranya  if so  isn t that exactly what the northeastern separatists are saying  the fact is  the leadership of the armed forces has merely jaywalked into the policy vacuum left by the upa. at one point  it had got so frustrating that the newspaper i worked for even carried a half serious editorial asking why the admiral was letting his navy down by also not coming out to say that under no circumstances would he allow his warships and submarines to be used against the maoists.since we have been jolted into saying and listening to rude things this week  here is another. how are we to explain this utter indifference to the loss of police and paramilitary life in east central india  could it be that we put a different value to the life of an indian soldier depending on the colour of his uniform  how many ob vans follow the coffins of crpf men who die fighting what our prime minister describes as our gravest security threat  which ministers visit their families  obviously  the netasgo where ob vans are. why does the air chief get away with his contemptuous dismissal of the perfectly valid demand that there be a proper inquiry into how his crew fled with unsoldierly cowardice from their downed helicopter  leaving an injured comrade in it  he was from the police  you see.also read  urban naxal is the new enemy    useful idiot  bjp needs for     i have made my living as a reporter covering wars and strife all over the country and elsewhere  notably sri lanka when the ipkf was there. i have said often that the only time i struggled  and failed to keep my clinical  reporter s impartial reserve was when i saw the body of an

rahul gandhi can t imitate modi to defeat modi
text size  a  a rahul gandhi s actions and antics are good for headlines  but he needs to show some originality.congress president rahul gandhi is on a pilgrimage to kailash mansarovar. lord shiva had come to his rescue this april when his plane had plunged       feet on the way to karnataka. and so this journey to mount kailash  shiva s abode in mythology  to seek his blessings and drink the sin cleansing water of mansarovar lake.you will get both  paap aur shraap   sin and curse  if you come between bhole shankar and rahul who is  immersed in his devotion   congress spokesperson randeep surjewala cautioned the bjp leaders friday.in the coming days  we should see many pictures of rahul doing a parikrama of mount kailash   possibly with a big teeka on his forehead  if not draped in gerua vastra or saffron robes. it will mark the culmination of what started with the gujarat assembly election last year  the image makeover of rahul as a janeu dhari devout hindu.what rahul didn t say in londonover the past decade since his induction as the congress general secretary  he has evolved from a starry eyed idealist with contempt against the prevailing  system  into a hug and wink politician who is as excited giving a call  along with comrade sitaram yechury  to the workers of india to unite as he is about visiting temples.also read  the cardinal rules of politics rahul gandhi needs to learn from young tejashwi yadavwith a plain face  he recently attributed the      lok sabha election loss to the  gen next vs old guard  tussle  giving his london audience no inkling about his own role. rahul was as much  if not more  responsible for the upa s ouster as narendra modi.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowas the party s heir apparent then  rahul went about publicly undermining the credibility of pm manmohan singh and his government with gusto  trashing an ordinance cleared by the union cabinet as  complete nonsense .he unleashed the environment   forest minister  jairam ramesh  on industrialists  and silently watched senior leaders and ministers make  rahul for pm  clamour. singh offered to step down several times during his second stint but sonia gandhi dissuaded him  say those privy to the happenings.rahul showcased his decision to hold internal elections in the youth congress and the nsui as a testimony to his commitment to  democratise  the party. but when it came to the election of the congress working committee  the party s apex decision making body  he conveniently looked the other way as a resolution was passed to authorise him to nominate cwc members.not a reluctant politicianon thursday  as rahul began his presser  he asked journalists half in jest and half in sarcasm   so are you writing freely or under pressure  there is general mood in the country that people hesitate to speak  you have our full support.  it was meant to be a jibe at modi government which  the opposition party alleges  is trying to intimidate and throttle the media.however  coming from him  those words sounded a bit rich. in       when some tv channel journalists had gatecrashed an nsui workshop and picked up some copies of presentations  a livid rahul had accused them of being  thieves  and called the police to register a case.also read  it is time rahul gandhi and congress stop being afraid of the      questionrahul has obviously evolved. he is not a reluctant politician anymore  he revels in politics  although his detractors have questions about his calibre  tenacity and perseverance. he is ready to match modi word to word  mud to mud. surveys indicate his growing acceptability  although he remains far behind modi in terms of popularity ratings.congress  strategy for     there are three questions that need to be looked at for any reasonable estimation of the congress  prospects in       is the modi regime more corrupt than the congress led upa  is rahul a bigger hindu than modi  and  has modi failed people more than the manmohan sonia rahul trio did since the nda government assumed power in       investigative agencies have gone after opposition leaders for their alleged acts of omissions and commissions. the      lok sabha elections could be the first in independent india when the ruling party would seek a renewed mandate citing corruption charges against opposition parties.but  the persistent campaign against the rafale fighter jets may drown all the noise about the upa scams. and the credit for this must be given to the nda government s dogged and inexplicable refusal to make the price of the aircraft public.what has emboldened the opposition party is the bjp s diffidence in responding to allegations regarding bjp president amit shah. describing demonetisation as a scam  rahul claimed that scrapped currency worth rs     crore was exchanged in a gujarat cooperative bank of which shah is a director. the bjp remained silent. rahul has also been publicly targeting shah for controversial financial dealings of his son jay  but the bjp  after some initial reactions  has chosen to ignore it.the congress may achieve some degree of success in creating doubts in people s minds  but would that be enough for them to decide to vote out modi government  it s anybody s guess  especially when the anti modi camp would comprise leaders such as rahul  lalu yadav  mayawati  mulayam singh yadav  chandrababu naidu  ajit singh  and mamata banerjee.as for the second question about rahul outdoing modi s hindu credentials  it s a convoluted strategy of a party that had once called modi a  merchant of death  in the context of the post godhra riots. as all india majlis e ittehadul muslimeen  aimim  mp asaduddin owaisi told theprint recently   you can t become the bjp to defeat the bjp . those who have voted for modi as  hindus  are unlikely to switch their loyalty to rahul  while his temple visits may not change the voting behaviour of others. in its desperate quest for  hindu  votes  the congress instead might be losing the trust of those who have more mundane things in mind when they cast their franchise.also read  rajiv gandhi played both ways and lost  now rahul is trying his hand at soft hindutvaon the third question about the delivery in governance  modi government is on the back foot  notwithstanding the impressive gdp growth in the first quarter of the year. people may not be totally disillusioned with modi yet but they are asking questions on the rationale behind demonetisation  lack of jobs  growing interest rate  and increase in prices of petroleum products   issues that matter in their day to day life.spin doctors of the government may be harping on the strong fundamentals of the economy and the policy paralysis during the upa regime  but it may not be enough to convince people who voted for modi expecting the moon. the silver lining for the bjp  however  is that rahul  with no administrative experience  can t be showcased as a role model either. nor can other contenders such as mamata or mayawati fit into that role.rahul s words  actions and antics have been good for headlines  but he needs to show some originality  instead of using tricks from modi s playbook to defeat modi.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis   only you can fix it you are reading this because you value good  intelligent and objective

sachin pilot   co will be   th breakaway from congress. but only    survived on their own
text size  a  a sometime in      when senior congress leader arjun singh was having a titanic battle of supremacy with then prime minister and aicc chief p.v. narasimha rao  i remember running into congress general secretary buddha priya maurya. he was a dalit leader from uttar pradesh where a large number of congress leaders and workers had turned against rao. so  i asked maurya a provocative question on why he was not supporting arjun singh. maurya was not offended. in his measured voice  he said   i hail from atrauli  aligarh where there is a saying that one wishes for a son in law or leader better than oneself. and i do not consider arjun to be better than me. in the ongoing tussle between sachin pilot and the congress high command  the personality of rahul gandhi and his impending return as the   th president of the indian national congress is posing a similar resistance. like jyotiraditya scindia  pilot and a few others  who will probably quit the party in the months to come   fancy themselves as tad better than rahul  in political acumen  social and management skills. post the      lok sabha election  many current and erstwhile members of  team rahul  are beginning to look down on him. instead of narendra modi as heir tormentor and wrecker in chief  in private conversations  they blame rahul gandhi for their defeat.the congress narrative of rewarding sachin pilot with a lok sabha berth at the age of     ministerial responsibility at    and post of deputy chief minister at    is proving to be counter productive because many young dynasts  who have been beneficiaries of similar largesse and patronage  deeply resent this  mai baap  culture. according to them  the meteoric rise of pilot  scindia  milind deora  jitin prasada  priya dutt   all second or third generation dynasts   was a result of their sweat and in spite of the gandhis.if pilot indeed breaks away from the congress  it will be the   th time the grand old party will be witnessing some kind of split.also read  why it s unfair to blame ashok gehlot or congress for sachin pilot s unreasonable ambitionsa third forcecongress ideologue v.n. gadgil would say congress leaders quit the party as lions and return as lambs. there is a grain of truth in it   just about    breakaway outfits survived  including some under illustrious figures like sharad pawar  mamata banerjee  jagan mohan reddy  k. chandrashekhar rao  and mufti mohammad sayeed.if pilot s rebellion does not go the scindia way  and if the gandhi family doesn t placate him enough  there is a third way  he can break away and form a regional party. but there is a flip side too. each time the congress faced a third party in a state  it found itself marginalised. delhi  andhra pradesh  telangana  west bengal  maharashtra  uttar pradesh and bihar are some such states where the congress staging a comeback on its own has become a distant dream.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for

would be carving a niche for himself in rajasthan while maintaining equal distance from the bjp and the congress. any tacit or direct alliance with the bjp would foreclose the  third force  option. if he chooses to stay away from power dynamics and lets bjp s vasundhara raje scindia dethrone ashok gehlot  pilot can pitch himself as a credible alternative in the      assembly election. this would require tremendous patience  application and resisting the constant temptation of high offices. more importantly  keeping elected representatives on his side would be extremely demanding.also read  pilot  scindia rebellion not because of top leadership. congress  crisis is structuralno  forever unlike religion  loyalty in politics is conditional and transactional. when indira gandhi was voted out of power in       d.k. barooah   who had  in famously coined the  indira is india and india is indira  slogan   had switched sides. veteran congress leader vidya charan shukla had deposed before the shah commission of inquiry after indira gandhi lost power. he also left the congress  but rejoined later.when the congress under sitaram kesri was tottering in december       nehruvian mani shankar aiyar joined the trinamool congress. mani  however  returned to the parent organisation alleging that the mamata led trinamool was nothing but a  fourth football club of bengal . the stories of barooah  shukla and aiyar should be a lesson in politics   nothing is permanent.a cursory look at contemporary congress politics would show that friends  peers or white collar professionals do not last long. megastar amitabh bachchan s parting with his childhood friend singularly contributed to prime minister rajiv gandhi s downfall. as i wrote in my book  neta abhineta  bollywood star power in indian politics  when a disillusioned bachchan left politics  the allahabad lok sabha by elections in      gave the fragmented opposition a sense that together they can humble the congress  which then had     mps in lok sabha.but bachchan wasn t the only one who deserted rajiv gandhi. arun nehru and arun singh  who were successful corporate and business honchos selling paint and shoe polish  deserted rajiv when the beleaguered prime minister needed them the most. in contrast   blue collar  political aides such as yashpal kapoor  r. dhawan  m.l. fotedar and vincent george stood by indira  rajiv and sonia gandhi like rocks  even after experiencing neglect and humiliation.also read  sachin pilot has done the unthinkable   united all tv channels from ndtv to republicthe dev anand

gandhi  as interim aicc chief  is set to complete a year inaugust      and wants rahul to step in her shoes. there are some in the congress who ruefully say a formidable challenge to rahul from within would have had greater impact than the  exit door policy  adopted by the likes of scindia.however  a counter argument is that given the farcical nature of party polls  even a  weak  and lacklustre sitaram kesri could defeat the mighty sharad pawar and dynamic rajesh pilot simply because kesri was the incumbent congress president. the sonia versus jitendra prasada contest was even more ludicrous  simply because  jitty  bhai was shown black flags and found state party unit offices shut when he tried convincing district and state level party delegates.a political life outside the congress would not be easy for sachin pilot unless he travels on the scindia path of either joining or aligning with the bjp. a third front in rajasthan is non existent as of now. there is no dearth of congress leaders itching to come out of the party provided there is a non bjp platform with a centrist agenda.in the absence of resources  ideological clarity and pan india identity  a pragmatic pilot may not want to go the dev anand way. the actor had  in          painstakingly formed the  national party of india  to oppose both the indira gandhi led congress and the janata party. the likes of vijaya lakshmi pandit and nani palkiwala had joined his party  but they all insisted on going to rajya sabha instead of fighting direct elections   much like jyotiraditya scindia now. dev anand s shop closed

the cardinal rules of politics rahul gandhi needs to learn from young tejashwi yadav
text size  a  a narendra modi is not a politician who will give up easily and let someone else take his crown away.congress president rahul gandhi refuses to learn one cardinal rule of politics

in tv studios show. it seems to have been replaced with an  otherisation  campaign.this deviation from the promised path is something that the opposition needs to highlight.if the congress has to put up a semblance of a fight against the politically belligerent duo of modi and bjp chief amit shah  it needs to understand that twitter gets you followers not voters. rahul and his party need to stop their twitter politics and instead take to the streets  highlighting the government s failures.also read  in the rahul vs modi battle  why shobhaa de would choose duffer over demagoguethey need to

none.if twitter and social media could win a party elections  divya spandana and the congress it cell s caustic memes and clever questions would have ensured that siddaramaiah and not h.d. kumaraswamy

opposition parties  is the answer to new india s woes.contrast the bjp s war room action with the scenario in the congress camp where rahul s supporters seem to suggest that there is still time before the voter enters the polling booth in     . in doing so  they possibly seem to ignore the fact that the groundwork for the lok sabha elections will be laid in the coming assembly elections.if  for

that the bjp will use every trick in the trade to retain the state.the congress may also have a real chance in madhya pradesh and chhattisgarh  but does the party leadership have what it takes to defeat the bjp in its own game at several gatherings  one finds people  who are keen to see modi lose  getting exasperated with the congress  lack of can do attitude.the congress  by now  should have

sachin pilot is not himanta biswa. every congress rebel cannot win elections for bjp
text size  a  a barely    hours after kicking out its  young and promising leader  sachin pilot from the post of rajasthan deputy chief minister and state unit president  the congress appealed to him to return to the party and sort out  any differences  he might have with chief minister ashok gehlot.for now  sachin pilot has made clear that he is not joining the bharatiya janata party  bjp   which was all too eager to welcome the congress leader  as well as perhaps the    mlas who support him  into its fold. but there are a few things that the bjp must keep in mind.it is no secret anymore that there are many disgruntled elements in the congress wishing to quit the  sinking ship . the bjp s resolve of a  congress mukt bharat  is seemingly being implemented by the congress.so  sachin pilot s declaration cannot be considered a solemn promise made under oath. as the events unfold  there could be many more surprises. in such a scenario  the bjp would do well to listen to internal warnings.also read  bjp ally says vasundhra raje asked congress mlas to support gehlot  keep away from pilotcareful  bjpfor a while now  a small but strong minority voice has been warning the bjp high command not to entertain every rebel who comes knocking its doors  especially the ones who have  inherited  leadership as a right of succession rather than earn it through hard work  ideological commitment or selfless service and sacrifice.in a cadre based party like the bjp  such late comers and back door entrants from the opposition camp seem to add very little value. it is even more pertinent in rajasthan  where the bjp has good cadre strength  deep roots and popular leadership at all levels.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions.

on the strength of outstanding charisma of prime minister narendra modi and superb strategies of home minister amit shah. the newcomers rarely add any value to the party.the bjp may fancy improving its prospects of victory in constituencies where the rebel leader s influence is greater  and  as elections approach  the number of rebels wishing to join it would arguably increase  but the party must still watch out for unintended consequences and listen to the voices within.also read  congress loses big when a pilot or scindia rebels but the  privileged  are ultimate losersanother crisis for

so  sachin pilot  who is credited with winning the state for the congress  would take over the reigns from the cm. but the fact remains that gehlot s contribution was nothing to be overlooked  considering the old war horse is endowed with vast experience in strategising and governance.his  magic   gehlot is believed to have learned magic tricks from his father  worked in maharashtra where the congress  according to him  had given up even before the election. speaking at an event  he had said   realising that the party couldn t succeed  they  congress in maharashtra and haryana  stopped trying to make any effort to win the assembly elections. the party should fight elections with all their strength and energy and not with a defeatist mindset. at a time when he was widely expected to play an important role in the party at the centre  he was shifted to rajasthan and had to fight for his supremacy.  i deserved to be the cm   ashok gehlot had said in july     .  it was clear who

ready to roll out the red carpet. most of these leaders increasingly realise the futility of continuing in a party that has no political future  at least in the near future. a political person with high investments in public life and long years to go would certainly be worried about his her return on investments and hence look for greener pastures in the bjp.it is not surprising that while rahul gandhi remained low key in the rebellion episode  priyanka gandhi  in the middle of shifting house  reportedly called pilot four times and asked him not to quit the party even if he was not attending meetings called by cm gehlot.political parties are increasingly becoming leader oriented rather than ideology based. indispensability of leadership flies against the basic tenets of democracy. the first family of the congress is proving to be a liability for the party. at some stage  highly talented individuals could make an exit  cobble up another platform and float a new avatar under a new

pilot  scindia rebellion not because of top leadership. congress  crisis is structural
text size  a  a the defection of jyotiraditya scindia and the rebellion of sachin pilot has brought the congress party s internecine politics to the fore. a standard narrative around these rebellions is that the congress party can no longer retain its popular  younger leaders and that the central leadership  i.e.  the gandhi trio   sonia  rahul  and priyanka   are to be blamed. in our view  this is rather simplistic and maybe a misplaced understanding of why the congress party is imploding. in reality  the current crisis in the congress party is structural.let us begin with some plain facts. all parties in india have a factional conflict. even the cadre based parties like the bharatiya janata party  bjp  or the communist party of india  marxist   or family run parties like the samajwadi party  sp  or the nationalist congress party  ncp  are not an exception. after all  parties are made up of factions. it is the role of the party leaders to manage the emerging competition among the factions. sometimes  the factional management is handled by the state unit. in other cases  the central leadership has to intervene to sort out factional conflict. this is a long standing feature of indian party politics.also read  sachin pilot has done the unthinkable   united all tv channels from ndtv to republicwhere lies the blame scindia and pilot headed their factions in madhya pradesh and rajasthan. both sought more power representation for their wings or themselves. while pilot had ambitions to become the rajasthan chief minister  scindia wanted a more significant role in madhya pradesh. neither scindia nor pilot could attain their political goals.in mp and rajasthan  then  a less charitable but entirely plausible interpretation of the actions of both scindia and pilot is that while they led a minority faction yet they tried to hold the elected congress governments hostage. the steps taken by scindia and pilot make it a simple case of minority faction blackmail made possible because of ruthless electoral arithmetic. there is an opposition party  bjp  in both states with enough numbers to form the government with the help of  defectors . scindia was successful right away because the congress had far fewer seats to play within madhya pradesh. in rajasthan  the congress has a greater buffer and thus foiled pilot s attempt. in fact  the series of events in rajasthan since may      suggests that gehlot carefully precipitated a crisis  calculated the fallout at each step  and pilot got played.a dominant interpretation lays the blame for the congress party s crisis at the central leadership s doorstep. in this interpretation  scindia and pilot could have been mollified  appeased  accommodated  or given madhya pradesh and rajasthan s reins. there is an alternative interpretation. neither scindia nor pilot had enough mlas on their side for the congress leadership to put their weight behind their factions. according to news reports  pilot wished to be named as rajasthan cm in the coming days months. would the ashok gehlot faction  which is clearly the larger of the two  have accepted the central leadership s support to the smaller faction as a fait accompli  would they not have defected realpolitik would suggest that the congress leadership had no other option. it had to go with the larger faction. could it have intervened on pilot s behalf and moved some mlas from the gehlot faction  possibly. but  would that defection have been large enough to reduce the gehlot faction to less than    mlas  maybe  but possibly not.we are deeply grateful to

nowalso read  why it s unfair to blame ashok gehlot or congress for sachin pilot s unreasonable ambitionswhy the central leadership is in a spotcritics of the congress party blame the central leadership s inability to control minority factions  especially when they can destabilise state governments and rob the party of chances to establish itself as a contender for national power. it is beyond doubt that congress s central leadership is having difficulty in controlling minority factions because the party is no longer in power at the centre. while it is possible  but in the world of power politics  less plausible  that a party can be held together by the loyalty of state politicians to the central leadership. loyalty goes only so far  scindia and pilot s story are a good testament to this.when congress was in power in delhi  it could easily accommodate minority factions  interests in multiple ways. for example  it could give the minority faction some resources or share of power in the central government. moreover  the minority faction was aware that while their party is ruling in new delhi they have limited options. there were no real alternatives with whom the minority faction would have aligned without incurring a cost  read income tax raids etc . and thus  their threats to exit if the demands were not met  were less credible. a minority faction of the bjp in gujarat today cannot threaten the ruling government s stability because its threat is not credible. if it left the party where would it go  into the wilderness also read  covid delayed sachin pilot s revolt  he had planned exit in march  congress insiders claimfor long term gainsit is conceivable that the congress party s leadership has now decided to take short term losses for the party s longer term viability in states like madhya pradesh and rajasthan. maybe  it now expects the state units to solve its internecine conflicts by themselves. if younger politicians like scindia and pilot want to be successful  they have to work with other factions in their party  with leaders they do not like  and build a career from the ground up rather than rushing to delhi to defend them and their political ambitions. and herein lies the crux of the current crisis in the congress party. the gandhi trio should not expect young and ambitious politicians like scindia and pilot to fight the factional battles in their respective states when until now the central leadership has handed them positions of power on a platter  union ministries and state party chiefs.to sum up  power distribution in any party purely based on loyalty to the high command will sooner or later implode. especially  when the party is not in power. today the congress party s chances of acquiring power in new delhi in the immediate future appear bleak  and therefore minority factions can make credible threats to exit the organisation. state politicians of the congress are doing what faction leaders do all over the world   look for chances to enhance their power  either within the party or while the option still exists by exiting and either joining another party or forming a new outfit. the congress high command should be aware of its limitations in managing minority coalitions without power and resources. however  that is not an easy task and is a real test for any leader.pradeep chhibber is a

why it s unfair to blame ashok gehlot or congress for sachin pilot s unreasonable ambitions
text size  a  a sachin pilot is not joining the bjp after all  he has made it clear. he makes it sound like that s coming out of some commitment to the congress party. it is obvious  however  that pilot couldn t gather the support of enough mlas to be of any use to the bjp.when pilot fled jaipur  he first claimed he had the support of    mlas  which would have brought the ashok gehlot government below the majority mark. however  sitting in a hotel in bjp ruled haryana  pilot probably couldn t gather the support of any more than the    mlas who had travelled with him. for the bjp to have any play in the game  it needed at least    to rebel.the pilot rebellion has thus turned out to be a damp squib. it has also shown that all those who were blaming the congress party for not being able to manage the differences between ashok gehlot and sachin pilot were wrong. in fact  this is one case where the congress party did well from beginning to end.also read  worked hard to defeat bjp  won t join it  says sachin pilot after congress action against hima stitch in timeon tuesday  the congress sacked sachin pilot from the posts of deputy chief minister and rajasthan pradesh congress committee president. there was something unusual about this  the party usually waits passively for events to unfold and suffer their consequences.in madhya pradesh  kamal nath and digvijaya singh looked on as jyotiraditya scindia pulled the rug from under their feet. by contrast  chief minister ashok gehlot in rajasthan acted in time and prevented sachin pilot from doing a scindia.it is strange that the people who were criticising the congress party for not being able to save its government in madhya pradesh are now criticising the congress party for trying to save its government in rajasthan.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowthe myth of pilot s achievementthere s a myth that sachin pilot was the reason why the congress won rajasthan in        and thus deserved to be made chief minister.it is well known that voters in rajasthan like to flip between the congress and the bharatiya janata party  bjp  every five years. it s called turning the roti  lest it burns. this idea is so ingrained in the minds of rajasthan s voters that the state s assembly election is too boring to cover.in       it was the congress party s turn anyway. besides  the bjp was adamant on making its own chief minister  vasundhara raje scindia  lose badly. bjp rss cadres were so vehemently opposed to her that they would openly raise slogans against her in rallies and nobody seemed to stop them.for a victory so inevitable  the congress should have won a two thirds majority. but under sachin pilot s leadership  the party won just    of     seats   the bjp won   . instead of taking this as a sign of failure  sachin pilot claimed credit for the victory and threatened rebellion if he wasn t made chief minister. his supporters even took to vandalism.also read  covid delayed sachin pilot s revolt  he had planned exit in march  congress insiders claimwhy gehlot deserved to be cmthe      assembly election was a contest between gehlot sponsored candidates and pilot sponsored candidates  whether or not they were contesting from a congress ticket. as more gehlot allied mlas won  sachin pilot automatically lost the claim to the chief minister s chair  morally and politically. the idea that sachin pilot was key to why congress won rajasthan is a myth created by the liberal english media in delhi  which is shamefully biased in favour of pilot.this was a poor reflection on pilot as a politician. pilot s case is that he deserved to be cm because he worked hard in the state for five years  but gehlot has been working for nearly    years. despite having a free run in rajasthan as pradesh congress committee  pcc  chief for five years  with gehlot busy in national politics  pilot couldn t displace him as the numero uno congress leader in public perception in the state.pilot accepted the compromise formula  or did he keeping this situation in mind  the congress high command made sure sachin pilot was made deputy chief minister with not one or two  but five key portfolios. against the principle of one leader one post  pilot was also allowed to retain the powerful political post of pcc chief. besides  some of the mlas loyal to him were also made ministers.this was in stark contrast to madhya pradesh  where jyotiraditya scindia  having rejected the deputy cm s post  found himself completely sidelined by the kamal nath digvijaya singh duo. these two seniors wouldn t even let him have a rajya sabha seat. pilot  by contrast  got more than what he deserved.instead of being grateful and content  he positioned himself against the chief minister from day one.ever since he moved to rajasthan after       pilot split the party into two. every worker had to choose whether they were in the pilot camp or the gehlot camp. as deputy cm  he continued to act as the challenger rather than a member of the government. ashok gehlot was forced to answer in the same language. pilot would have been wise to bury the hatchet with gehlot  but chose not to do so  hoping to destabilise the government and become chief minister by hook or crook.after the fall of the congress government in madhya pradesh  sachin pilot clearly took some inspiration from jyotiraditya scindia.also read  sachin pilot sacked as rajasthan dy cm   state congress chief  says  truth can t be defeated who made the first move there s a narrative that ashok gehlot  laid a trap  for sachin pilot   baiting  him to a situation where he had no option but to exit. the story begins with the rajya sabha elections last month. as is well known  the bjp tries to move in on mlas to win as many rajya sabha seats as possible. both congress and bjp put their mlas in resorts before the rajya sabha elections. ashok gehlot alleged the same poaching was taking place in rajasthan. sachin pilot met the congress high command in delhi  after which the rebellion was postponed.meanwhile  the rajasthan police intercepted phone calls between individuals allegedly associated with the bjp  where horse trading was allegedly being discussed. two individuals were arrested. since the phone calls allegedly suggested that sachin pilot was negotiating with the bjp  he was summoned by the rajasthan police s special operations group or sog. this summon notice is being portrayed as undue aggression by ashok gehlot that left sachin pilot with no choice but to leave.this narrative presenting ashok gehlot as the aggressor presumes that sachin pilot was innocent and did not attempt toppling his own government. to believe this is a bit naive since pilot s response was to immediately make public his efforts to topple the government  refuse to attend congress meetings despite a whip  and move to bjp ruled haryana mlas loyal to him.pilot is making the sog notice look like an affront but it doesn t accuse him of anything  only seeks his co operation in an investigation. if he has nothing to hide  why run away it was pilot who made the first move  gehlot has merely defended his fort. the police investigation into horse trading charges  armed with the evidence of intercepted phone calls  was ashok gehlot s attempts to save his own government.also read  cm gehlot lists   reasons why congress took the  sad  decision on sachin pilota general who overestimates the size of his armyeveryone s favourite whipping boy  the congress party  has got a lot of flak for not being able to manage the differences between ashok gehlot and sachin pilot. however  it is by now clear that the congress actually managed the tussle well  giving sachin pilot a long rope.ashok gehlot has exposed how pilot had been holding the congress party to ransom without even having the bargaining power to do so. unlike his friends in the delhi media who bought his tall claims  the congress party knew his strength or the lack of it   a mere    mlas.according to sachin pilot s supporters in delhi  a man who can t get the support of more than    mlas somehow deserves to be rajasthan chief minister  congress pcc chief  congress national president  congress  prime ministerial face and so on.the same people who accuse rahul and priyanka gandhi of being entitled  arrogant dynasts are now forced to accept that sachin pilot is the same  an entitled  arrogant dynast who thinks the rajasthan cm s chair is his birthright.sachin pilot has no casus belli to rebel   he doesn t have the numbers  ashok gehlot is still popular  the election isn t nigh  and the coronavirus pandemic is the wrong time to be planning to topple one s own government. in these circumstances  the congress has  for once  done a good job in trying to save its government from an expansionist bjp.the author is contributing editor  theprint. views are personal.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis

corruption. worse  with a few days to go before the games were to open  the foreign press played out horrifying scenes about the shabby state of the games village and the lack of readiness about other infrastructure.all of india watched in shock and horror when the army s cadres were called into the heart of delhi to build an overhead walkway outside the jawaharlal nehru stadium.but when the games opened  the spectacular ceremony evaporated all the misgivings and criticisms that had been showered upon the political class. and then when the entire stadium  all        people  erupted around a

gowda  were particularly interested in sports. rao was too busy saving his minority government in the aftermath of the demolition of the babri masjid  while gowda and gujral were gone before you could say  khul ja sim sim . vajpayee  like manmohan singh  would much rather use sports to improve political ties  like playing cricket with pakistan .the last time a prime minister was interested in sports was indira gandhi. she pushed through the asian games in       realising that sports was one way of also showcasing india s incredible potential to the rest of the world.also read  kashmir s

uttar pradesh into smaller statesbrahmin appeasement is not a new thingthis is not for the first time that the bsp and the congress are trying to woo the brahmins.rahul gandhi has gone too far to prove his kaul brahmin ancestry and also found out that he belongs to dattatreya gotra. the congress  structure is still brahmin dominated despite the party not getting substantial brahmin votes. this is the legacy of the past when the brahmins were the captive vote bank of the congress.the bsp has also gone the extra mile to adapt to sarvajan politics. it has appointed brahmins as leader of the party in both the houses of parliament lok sabha and rajya sabha. i can t recall any other national party to have ever done something like this. during the bsp government in up  the brahmins got the maximum number of cabinet berths. the bsp also fielded largest brahmin contingent in the      lok sabha election in up. despite that  all its brahmin candidates  other than ritesh pandey  lost. pandey won from ambedkar nagar seat. the district has around    per cent dalit population and negligible brahmin population.also read  the fundamental flaw in priyanka gandhi s uttar pradesh strategybut why have brahmins remained coy notwithstanding their outreach to the brahmin community  these parties are not getting any traction from them. according to the post poll survey by lokniti csds  more than    per cent brahmins in up voted for the bjp in      lok sabha election. this is in continuation with the pattern started in      lok sabha election  which was repeated in      assembly election.only the congress of yesteryears has enjoyed such loyalty of brahmin voters. the congress lost brahmin support in the     s and early     s. political scientist arvind kumar cites five primary reasons for the disenchantment of the brahmins from the congress and their flocking towards the bjp   . the implementation of mandal commission report and obc reservation in central government jobs and educational institutions   . the exodus of kashmiri pandits   . shah bano judgment and perceived act of the congress to appease the muslims   . aggressive assertion of the dalits and the obcs in the social and political space  especially the rise of kanshiram  mulayam singh and lalu prasad yadav   . proliferation of religious tv serials and resultant religiosity.after doing some brief experiments with regional political parties  the brahmins in north india  in       found their ultimate home in the bjp.the bjp is taking care of some of the main concerns of the brahmin community. the party has completely stopped the so called muslim appeasement  sachhar committee has demonstrated that this is entirely false notion  and rather started persecuting the minority through various means. some of these methods have the legal constitutional backing the citizenship amendment act and the national population register. other means include its offshoots indulging in mob lynchings  spreading the communal disharmony in the name of love jihad  spewing hate on social media and running campaigns to boycott muslim traders among others. the bjp has also acted decisively in jammu and kashmir by diluting article     and bifurcating the state. such acts too soothe the emotional wounds of the brahmins.the bjp is also working aggressively to restore the old brahminical caste order by undermining the provisions of reservation in government jobs and education. it has amended the article       and       to tweak the constitution so that the upper caste candidates can get    per cent ews reservation. though the congress and the bsp have supported the constitution amendment  the brahmins also know it well that these parties never took any initiative to implement savarna reservation.the narendra modi government is recruiting a large number of bureaucrats through lateral entry mechanism. this will also nullify some effects of the reservation policy. bjp led state governments have also placed the brahmins and the upper caste bureaucrats in key positions in ministries and other institutions.the modi government has also tried to nullify the sc st prevention of atrocities act. in       additional solicitor general maninder singh had told the supreme court that  in     of the cases filed under the act  the accused is acquitted and so these cases are fake.  this assertion of the law officer of the modi government had led to a judgment that had nearly finished the core objective of the sc st act. after nationwide protests  the government passed a bill to put the act back in its original shape.also read  on up s political turf  a new rivalry is unfolding  mayawati vs priyanka gandhibjp marinating the upper cast hegemonybrahmins have noticed the sincerity and honesty of the bjp in maintaining the hegemony of the caste structure. no other party can match the bjp in this arena as parties like the congress and the bsp have to cater to other voting blocs too. the congress can t shut the door on the muslims and the dalits  and the bsp can t antagonise its core dalit voters while appeasing the brahmins. this is a real catch    situation for the bsp as its core voters are ideologically trained to fight against the savarna hegemony  and if the party goes too far to woo the brahmins  then there is a chance that its core voters will desert it or may  at least  get disenchanted.but the main reason why the brahmins will not ditch the bjp is because in parties like the bsp  they will have a subservient role to play under a dalit dominated leadership. the experiment to include brahmins in the party undertaken by mayawati in the      up assembly election is a proof to this.today  both the bjp and bsp are trying to catch all  like the congress of yesteryears. the only difference between the two is that the bjp is wooing without disturbing the core of its political leadership it still cherishes the primacy of vedic hinduidm.even if there is a turf war going on between the thakurs and the brahmins in up  the bjp has enough elbow room to placate both the castes. as both the communities can be cajoled to see the muslims as common potent threat  and be convinced that only the bjp can keep the aspirations of the scs and the obcs in control  they will remain loyal to the party. there is no possibility of them joining the bsp or the congress. not in the near future.dilip mandal is the former managing editor of india today hindi magazine  and has authored books on media and sociology.subscribe to our channels on youtube

indian secularism still has a future if followers stop blame game with rss  rajmohan gandhi
text size  a  a this piece has been sparked by yogendra yadav s important article in theprint   this hindi book on indian secularism could have exposed liberals  but it was ignored.  i have not yet read abhay dubey s hindu ekta banam gyan ki rajniti  but the remarks that follow have been stimulated by yogendra s summary of the book s conclusions.read yogendra s article here  in which he lists several of dubey s crucial assessments  the defeat of secular politics is a defeat of secular ideology  the harsh truth that this defeat is well earned  the arrogance of the secular ideologues that made them overlook basic facts about the sangh parivar  and a quick reminder of the weaknesses of the secular politics   from exclusively focusing on minority rights to glossing over the congress  inconsistencies.many of the points that abhay dubey raises  and yogendra yadav summarises  are indisputable. defenders of secularism have often refused to look objectively at the sangh parivar  its diverse components  its strengths  weaknesses  achievements and failures. the failure of the congress to stand up to minority communalism over shah bano was an egregious blunder. but i am not so sure about the verdict that the secular ideology has been defeated.also read  this hindi book on indian secularism could have exposed liberals  but it was ignoredelection can t defeat what s in constitutionsome would argue  and i would join them  that the momentous defeats of secular politics during the last    plus years   first the lok sabha election results of         and then  after the    year spell of upa rule  the chain of defeats that began in        do not translate so readily into a defeat of secular ideology.without attempting a definition of  secular ideology   it may be suggested here that the preamble to our constitution  conveys  this ideology pretty well  and also that the rights to liberty and equality assured in the constitution give that ideology a solid grounding. today  we know  these rights are hardly secure. the wish to abrogate them may be seen all around us  and a climate may indeed be reached or created for an open attempt at abrogation.however  as long as  justice    liberty    equality    fraternity  and  the dignity of the individual  remain in the preamble  and are protected by our constitution s articles  we need not concede the secular ideology s defeat  and we must continue our protests against the steady flouting of the articles.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality

weaknesses for which they have been duly punished by our people  the ultimate rulers. but let us not forget that the latter   our crores of ranis  queens  and rajas  kings    repeatedly gave secular political parties the right to govern india. they did this  decade after decade  from      onwards. even after the      and      lok sabha elections  secular parties have received the popular mandate in several parts of india.also read  hate is hot in india. colder ideas like constitutional patriotism must work harder to winaccepting secularism despite deficienciesi will be the first to agree that india s governance was flawed from day one of swaraj. yet the congress party  holding aloft a much reviled banner of secular ideology  was elected again and again by our people  who knew that perfection does not exist on our soiled  if also sacred  dharti  land .the reviling of secular ideology had started before    august     . from the summer of       this condemnation was in violent flow. from much earlier  at least from the     s  a few muslim and hindu ideologues argued that hindus and muslims were two nations. the violence of          which was linked to the convulsing demand for partition  seemed to validate that belief.that s when a miracle happened. between      and       even as pakistan began its journey to an islamic state  and even while wounds of the      carnage were still fresh  india s leaders and constitution makers rejected the two nation ideology. thereafter  in elections held every five years  the people kept rejecting the two nation ideology even as they faced deficiencies in congress ministries at the centre and in the states.this is not the place to offer my understanding of how that miracle of         happened  but it seems undeniable that crucial to what unfolded was the clarity of several exceptional persons including m.k. gandhi  jawaharlal nehru  b.r. ambedkar  vallabhbhai patel  abul kalam azad  j.p. narayan and ram manohar lohia. all of them insisted that india belonged equally to hindus  muslims  sikhs  christians  everyone. that was the heart of their secular ideology.thanks to their uncompromising  publicly expressed and repeated stand against the two nation theory  and the backing they received from political and non political associates in the constituent assembly  the government  political parties and elsewhere  not only was our secular constitution put in place. secularism and pluralism seemed to enter india s bloodstream.that india belonged to all was accepted   it would appear   by the indian mind  which also seemed to recall that poets and saints had underlined that truth over the centuries in different parts of the land.also read  hindutva rise must be pinned on historians who told us hindus  muslims lived peacefully oncethe rss  controlif today  seven decades later  india s bloodstream shows angrier and less tolerant platelets  much of the blame doubtless falls on the congress and other secular parties. but the story is not as simple as that. credit  or responsibility  should also be assigned to the assiduous work for    continuous years of the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh  rss   whose members would call these platelets virile rather than virulent  and to the toxic nationwide campaigns for demolishing the babri masjid and installing a ram mandir in ayodhya.in more recent years  the success of the bharatiya janata party  bjp  and the spread of the hindu nationalist ideology has also been aided by the skills and stamina of men such as narendra modi and amit shah  by a flow of massive funds to the bjp  and by the sangh s mounting influence  if not control  in tv channels  social media  and institutions of the state.i accept that parts of the rss have drawn upon the social reformist tradition within hinduism. i agree that its exclusion of muslims has been successfully complemented by a campaign to include lower caste hindus. but let us recognise that steady pressure on public opinion from proponents of the secular ideology compelled the sangh parivar s reluctant deference to social reform and its eventual readiness to accord a few influential positions to lower caste hindus.we can welcome these tardy steps while renewing our opposition to the two nation ideology. if the sangh parivar can now move radically forward in its thinking  embrace muslims as equal partners in building india s future  and jettison the two nation theory  that would be a welcome culmination as the rss approaches its centenary.such a climax is unlikely. as is true of muslim nationalist movements in countries such as egypt  iran and turkey  and as was true for the pakistan demand  india s hindu nationalist campaign needs the  enemy other .also read  what gandhi thought of muslims and why that makes him our contemporaryindia s secularism withheld majoriatian risei don t know whether abhay dubey s book examines the global rise of the belief that a particular race or religion owns a nation  and that others must accept a junior status. but it is not hard to see that the sangh parivar s vision of a hindu india coincides with recep tayyip erdogan s picture of an islamic turkey  where the historic hagia sophia has now been decreed to become a mosque   with the banned muslim brotherhood s view of a sunni muslim egypt  with the vision of iran s ayatollahs of a pure  shiite iran  and with the dream of a white america passionately nursed by sections in the us under donald trump.for all their mistakes and failures  india s advocates of secularism are not the chief architects of the sangh parivar s rise. in fact  but for some of these champions  that rise would have come about much earlier. jawaharlal nehru was seeing into the future  not appeasing a minority  when in      he declared that the  communalism of the majority is far more dangerous than the communalism of the minority    because  as nehru added  it  wears the garb of nationalism.  his assessment has been confirmed in india  turkey and elsewhere.any discussion of the rise in india of hindu nationalism must frankly acknowledge two crucial weaknesses on the secular side. one has been the letting down of dalits and adivasis. the partnership when ambedkar worked with nehru  patel and company to produce our constitution of equality  was not reproduced in india s villages  in our cities  crammed bastis  or in our forest lands.all of us know that the contemporary lynching of muslims was preceded by  and is today accompanied by  the lynching of dalits and the uprooting of adivasis. the claim of  a nation for all  becomes a mere taunt when the cries of victims go unheard.great leaders bringing their egos to the battlefront  or to a leadership team  has been a second crucial weakness. after the emergency  morarji desai  charan singh and jagjivan ram were unable to stick together even for two years. in          it took less than a year for v.p. singh  devi lal and chandra shekhar to split up. more recently  congress leaders in madhya pradesh fell out  and now there is the sachin pilot eruption in rajasthan.also read  legal autocrats are on the rise. they use

 and trudge  and put on masks so that they and others may live  don t ask for perfection. the ability to rein in personal ambitions  which is easier said than done  and stick it out is enough for them.abhay dubey is right to say that most critics of the sangh parivar do not look straightforwardly at it. all hindu nationalists are not identical. nor are they personally flawed  except in the sense that all humans have shortcomings.what should be my attitude to them  i unreservedly reject their doctrine that hindus must rule over or absorb muslims  christians  sikhs and other non hindus. but as fellow humans and fellow indians  members of the sangh parivar are entitled to my attention and goodwill.those who believe in equality and in an india for all  also have my goodwill. in their case i would  in addition  endorse their ideology. i would not focus on their human imperfections. as long as they stand up to exclusion  disdain and hate  as long as they oppose ideologies of domination and hierarchy  they are my partners. they may belong to a political party  a caste  a religion  a tribe  or a state different from mine  but if they subscribe to liberty  equality and fraternity  they have my solidarity.if enough of india s countless lovers of liberty  equality and fraternity stick together  refusing to waste energy in the blame game  not only secular ideology but

no votes  ineffective gandhis   larger malaise underlying congress  gehlot pilot spat
text size  a  a new delhi  what transpires between rajasthan chief minister ashok gehlot and deputy chief minister sachin pilot today is symptomatic of a larger malaise within the congress party  said theprint s editor in chief shekhar gupta in episode     of  cut the clutter . in the last two decades or so  what has changed within the congress party is also what has remained the same   said gupta.what has changed most of all is the strength of the dynasty that rules the congress party  that is the strength of the gandhi family. they simply cannot get votes for their party men and women to get elected anymore. in fact  they struggle to get votes for themselves.in the      elections  then party president rahul gandhi lost his amethi seat by a sizeable number of votes. so the ability of the gandhi family now to get votes for their own is gone.that s a big disadvantage in politics and yet what hasn t changed is their control over the party  which is probably the strongest ever in the history of the congress.india s first prime minister jawaharlal nehru had people who rebelled against him and who challenged him in the cabinet. former prime minister indira gandhi  too  had rebellions within her system.however  the congress of today has no such problem.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive

gehlot isn t the enemy  congress culture issustaining congress  fundamental contradictionthis has happened because of the way the congress party is constructed   it does not have a strong ideology binding people. most of the leaders in the congress party inherited their positions such as sachin pilot  milind deora  jitin prasada  and now bjp member jyotiraditya scindia.while they may swear by their ideological commitment   that only comes later. they want power.now  once you are there for power  then one thing you worry about is that one of your peers will reach the top. so then you get the  crabs in the pitcher  syndrome  which means if any crab is climbing up  other crabs will pull it down.on the other hand  if you have somebody from the dynasty  who you know is entitled to rule the party but at the same time they don t threaten you because you are not in competition with him or her  then you accept their dominance. in this sense  the gandhis don t threaten anybody.this is also why whenever you have a p.v. narasimha rao or sita ram kesari and they give you instructions  nobody follows them.however  when the gandhi s do some such thing  everybody falls in line because they are the leaders by default. so that is how this contradiction is sustained.also read  bjp is sceptical about sachin pilot s numbers  says it s ready to play a  test match rise of smaller  more effective dynastiesin many regions across the country  new dynasties have come up and have essentially taken away the congress party s vote  which has now become the  c team  in these states. the latest example of this was maharashtra where even the national congress party  ncp  went ahead of the congress.other dynasties in different parts of the country include the abdullahs in kashmir

together.so the congress party suffers both ways and this is the reason why its in such a big mess.even within the congress party  many dynasties have come up  for instance the amarinder singh dynasty in punjab  the hoodas and the surjewalas in haryana  and the dikshits in delhi  among others.this points towards a greater problem in the congress. they still think they are leaders but most of them

sachin pilot s anger is misplaced. ashok gehlot isn t the enemy  congress culture is
text size  a  a sachin pilot has finally declared war on the congress. this was long waiting to happen  ever since the congress top command chose veteran leader ashok gehlot over him as rajasthan chief minister after the december      assembly election. pilot made no bones about his resentment or of being short changed. since then  he has done precious little to cement his position as a politician or administrator  sulking all the time  targeting gehlot and turning into a rebel without a cause.sachin pilot should have left the congress long ago   for his long term political growth    not because of his rivalry with gehlot  but because of the top leadership of the congress which is selfish  directionless  insecure and over controlling.also read  rahul gandhi to launch video series

visioned. instead  had he decided to question his party s leadership for its ineptness  and reluctance to allow young and capable regional leaders to grow  pilot would have shown courage and conviction  rare in a party where everybody competes to display their loyalties to the gandhis. pilot s revolt should have been for principles  and not for power.sachin pilot   a second generation  committed congress leader who is a dynast  but has not taken his entitlement for granted   had all that it takes to set an example. unfortunately  the young leader ended up squandering that chance  and now appears to be someone who is only interested in the cm s chair. in politics  ambition is natural  important and fair. however  in his obvious quest for power  pilot has lost sight of the all important optics and the bigger picture of building a lasting legacy as a politician.also read  how and why ashok gehlot  baited  sachin pilot to turn rebelthe grounded  hard working dynastsachin

biggest detractors would deny how hard he had worked in rajasthan  shifting his base to the state and nurturing the party there. jolted by his own electoral loss in       pilot took nothing for granted  turning into every bit the rooted  committed politician he is today.given his hardwork and relentless statewide campaign ahead of the      assembly election  it was only natural for pilot to feel disappointed when gehlot was made the cm. the problem  however  is how he allowed himself to get completely consumed by the turf war with gehlot.also read  bjp is sceptical about sachin pilot s numbers  says it s ready to play a  test match the futile yearssachin pilot s anger and energies since the      assembly election win have been completely misplaced. gehlot isn t his enemy  the congress culture is. the internal war in rajasthan is but a manifestation of the rot in the congress party.ashok gehlot is a seasoned  well respected politician with a very strong hold over the party organisation in rajasthan. he was not an unlikely  or questionable choice as the cm. however  the congress  especially then party president rahul gandhi  could have taken a leap of faith and chosen youth and energy over age and experience. many  in fact  felt the decision was unfair to pilot.but once the call was taken and a beaming sachin pilot stood next to rahul gandhi and gehlot to show all was well  the rajasthan deputy cm s trajectory could have been different. sachin hasn t really been able to damage gehlot  neither politically nor in terms of his image. to bolster his slim majority  gehlot won over six mlas from the bahujan samaj party  further strengthening himself politically. administratively  the death of kids at a kota hospital did dent his image  but his seemingly competent handling of the covid crisis has made up for any other lapses in his    month old government. of course  gehlot has played every bit the cussed leader too  cornering pilot time and again and barely giving him any breathing space.but  what does sachin pilot has to show for himself  except for stepped up intra party bickering  he hasn t shone as an administrator or done much to further strengthen his political base.given the immediate trigger of pilot s revolt is the notice that has also been sent to the chief minister and others by the rajasthan police s special operation group in connection with the arrest of two bjp leaders for their alleged attempt to bring down the gehlot government  the desert drama only resembles a family soap opera.the rot in the congress starts from the top  and runs deep  and that is what sachin pilot should have rebelled against. pilot should have quit the congress because there is no real future for young  capable leaders as long as the gandhi family feels threatened by them. pilot should have moved on because the party s leadership cannot ensure electoral wins and does not quite care till it continues to call the shots. he should have found a new home

restless  young india has no connection to iits   iims  but rahul gandhi can t see it
text size  a  a neither is rahul gandhi young nor are his ideas.rahul gandhi was asked during an event in berlin what would be his message  as a youth icon  to motivate the youth.first off  why do people still consider rahul gandhi a  youth  leader  he s    years old. the average age of the indian population is    years and we are well on our way towards becoming the youngest country in the world by      with almost two thirds of our people in the working age group. it would be safe to say that rahul gandhi is not quite the young man anymore.but more importantly  even his ideas on the subject appear dated.the    year old  young  rahul responded to the question by saying   you are powerful and brave. futures are not built on anger and hate. politics in india is trying to tell you that the future is an angry one but your strength comes from love   affection  not anger.  he added   you can compete with anyone as an indian because over the last    years  the country has built infrastructure for you. this country has given you iits and iims. you owe it to the country and the poor to help them. don t work for yourself  you need to work for the weak and poor in india. also read  rahul gandhi is right  india s rss is a lot like the muslim brotherhoodin rahul gandhi s worldview   and practically every indian politician s worldview   the  youth  conjures up an image of engineers and mbas passing out from iits and iims  going abroad and working selfishly for themselves. this select group of elite individuals is the epitome of success in politicians  eyes and every young indian needs to aspire for it.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowthe reality is that iit  iim and nit graduates consist of only   per cent of our total student population at any given point in time. what s more  perhaps due to this bizarre worldview of our policy makers  more than    per cent of the whole country s higher education budget is spent on them. simply put  it s about time our leaders move out of this dated mentality and look at the problems of the actual the remaining    per cent of the students who attend     higher educational institutes in the country. they need to realise that young india  as it stands now  is uneducated  unemployed and unemployable. lofty ideas about their problems are just not going to cut it anymore.there is no denying that there is a job shortage. there is a very real fear that india is now in crisis mode. according to a world bank report  in      india had  .   crore unemployed people and this number is projected to go up to  .   crore by     . but indian students  in general  are also unemployed because they are simply not up to the mark  unskilled and ill equipped to do the jobs up for offer. we live in a country where for     vacant posts for peons in uttar pradesh    lakh people applied.     of them were doctorate degree holders fighting for a rs        per month job.the unemployment crisis intensifies when we consider the fact that o nly   per cent of our total workforce is skille d . so much so that companies like hcl technologies have started hiring high school kids for entry level jobs. they d rather spend money and time training these employees themselves than let them go through our engineering colleges and gain zero skills that they need to perform the required tasks. in simple words  india has a young demographic which is joining the workforce in huge numbers  in a situation when there are very few jobs available and when there are jobs  companies don t want to hire unskilled workers. this is a serious problem and our politicians don t seem to have solutions to it. they get away with giving wishy washy answers instead of actually considering the nuances and complexities of the situation.also read  inside india s giant ias coaching factories  hope  hype and big moneyall of this leads to an immense amount of frustration in a restless young population. that is when someone like narendra modi comes in and sells incredible dreams to young india.  anything is possible   he says.  become job creators instead of job seekers. even before modi came to power  all of his pre election speeches were laced with this dreamy imagery  which was meant to percolate into the minds of the frustrated jobless young indians and win them over. it might have worked then  but the big question is  will it work again it s not like rahul gandhi doesn t see the problem. in london  he made a blanket statement that  people support populist leaders like mr trump and mr modi because they are angry that they don t have a job. instead of solving this problem these leaders ride on that anger. they damage the country by this. it s time for rahul gandhi and our policymakers to move away from these oversimplified observations and rhetoric and understand the nuances of the issue.and they need to do it fast because young india is restless.meghnad s. is a political analyst and a parliament nerd.subscribe to our channels on

rahul gandhi is right  india s rss is a lot like the muslim brotherhood
text size  a  a but what has the congress done to counter it all these years founded in egypt in       the muslim brotherhood is an islamist organisation. it differs from jihadist organisations like al qaeda and isis in that it does not seek a violent revolution across borders to establish a muslim ummah. instead  the muslim brotherhood is okay with both democracy and the nation state.the central idea of the muslim brotherhood is to work with and through society  spreading its ideology among people. this will  in due course  help it capture state institutions through perfectly democratic means and then establish a theocratic state.rahul gandhi was thus not wrong when he compared muslim brotherhood to india s rashtriya swayamsewak sangh  rss . speaking in london  rahul said   rss is trying to change the nature of india. other parties haven t tried to capture india s institutions. rss  idea is similar to the idea of the muslim brotherhood in the arab world  and the idea is that one ideology should run through every single institution  one idea should crush all other ideas. also read  how many light bulbs does it take to change rahul gandhi clarifying his statement to a news agency  gandhi said   both organisations were founded in     s  both organisations view the electoral process as a means to capture. muslim brotherhood was banned after anwar sadat s assassination  and the rss too was banned after mahatma gandhi s assassination. women are not allowed in either of these organisations. so  there are tremendous similarities between both the organisations. striking similaritiesthe similarities in their outlook and strategies are actually striking. they both have the same objective  uniting people on the lines of the majority religious group and establishing the hegemony of that religious group over society and state alike.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowboth muslim brotherhood  mb  and the rss organise men for social action that is actually political. if the rss runs shakhas  the mb runs sports clubs. both run schools and do social service.they both think long term  ground up. they both seek to change hearts and minds in favour of their ideology. the mb s strategy of  tarbiyya   preaching and educating  sounds similar to that of the rss  which spreads its message through shakhas and the saraswati shishu mandirs alike. both seek to change the outlook of individuals  then families  and subsequently of society at large.they have both been banned off and on  although the mb has been banned far more often. both the rss and the mb show great flexibility  allying with liberals and secularists today  taking to violence tomorrow  and then shunning violence for mainstream acceptance.there are differences  of course. the rss did not participate in the indian freedom movement  whereas the mb got quickly drawn into the egyptian freedom movement against british colonial rule. for the mb  getting egypt rid of the british rule was part of its anti western agenda  which continues even today. yet  the rss was also shaped by the colonial experience. the rss website states the british  attempted to subvert the hindu mind . according to the rss  british colonial rule used english education to indoctrinate hindus into thinking that they were a  dying race  needed to be saved by westernisation. this feeling of a colonial assault on religious identity is shared between the mb and the rss.also read  the hypocrisy of rahul gandhi invoking guru nanak in front of nris in berlinboth the mb and the rss have been accused of using violence as a political means  especially against religious minorities. both deny the charges and are seen as taking recourse to plausible deniability.their outlook towards religious minorities is similar. both present religious minorities as having extra privileges  appeased by the secularists  and a threat to the religious majority to whom the nation rightfully belongs. the muslim brotherhood in egypt  for instance  feels that the country s coptic christians should pay a jizya tax since they are exempt from compulsory military service.the mb also regularly doubts if the religious minorities are patriotic. like the rss  the mb is accused of fanning the fire of hate against religious minorities. both love conspiracy theories.political proxieswhen sardar patel lifted the ban on the rss  he made them promise they won t participate in politics. so  the rss claims to be a cultural organisation  but it by passed this problem by creating a political front  the jana sangh  which later became the bharatiya janata party  bjp . similarly  religious groups were barred from contesting elections in egypt until     . to bypass this  the muslim brotherhood created a political front  the freedom and justice party  which first claimed it wouldn t contest elections but then it did.as a result  mohamed morsi became the first democratically elected president of egypt in     . a year later  the army removed him in a military coup amid widespread protests. the protests were on economic issues but also against the  brotherhoodisation  of egypt   the increasing islamisation of the country and the government  and the mb s capture of state institutions.this is again similar to how the rss puts its own people into institutions big and small when the bjp comes to power  seeking the dominance of its ideology on state and society.also read  if rahul gandhi can be cornered for       why not narendra modi for      the rss  commitment to democracy and fundamental rights is often doubted  although it claims to believe in democracy. similarly  many fear that the muslim brotherhood will give up its commitment to democracy once it captures power. after all  their slogan is  islam is the solution  and they openly seek to establish sharia  or islamic law. this is similar to how the rss wants to make india a  hindu rashtra   while claiming to be committed to the constitution of india  which is inherently non religious and secular.what did congress do rahul is right in comparing the mb to the rss  but he also needs to explain what his party has done to counter the rss s slow hindutvaisation of indian society. for    years  rahul s party ruled at the centre  but what did it do  his father  rajiv gandhi  and then the next congress prime minister narasimha rao gave in to the rss bjp blackmail in ayodhya. congress leader pranab mukherjee  former president of india  recently went to the rss headquarters and described rss founder keshav baliram hedgewar as a  great son of mother india .maybe rahul could learn some lessons from egypt s crackdown on muslim brotherhood  or perhaps it s too late for that since the rss  political front  the bjp  has managed to establish complete political hegemony.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis   only you can fix it you are reading this because you value good  intelligent and objective journalism. we

if rahul gandhi can be cornered for       why not narendra modi for      
text size  a  a india s well meaning media wants rahul gandhi to improve  but don t want narendra modi to even learn.from pandit nehru to indira gandhi to vajpayee and manmohan singh   everyone travelled abroad and addressed elite conferences  met celebrity media persons and  of course  heads of states. but mostly those visits made just news  rarely inviting acrimonious  cynical or unduly controversial comments.all that suddenly changed with prime minister narendra modi. he started globe trotting with the frequency that could even beat the pace of    . like modi  james bond too was fighting global terrorism. modi also has his  q  in ajit doval.either as a counter strategy or an image building exercise  rahul gandhi has also started traveling abroad on work. since all the elections have been turned into a modi versus rahul battle by the bjp  the media too looks at their foreign jaunts in the same competitive mode. in real terms  there is little to compare and judge.also read  here s why modi gets away with his gaffes  while rahul gandhi gets called pappumodi goes everywhere with a lot of energy and enthusiasm. from rwanda to russia  from brazil to belgium  and from vietnam to america  modi meets and hugs world leaders and urges them to join his fight against the menace of terrorism.in every city or town  from dubai to davos  he addresses the infatuated indian diaspora. he uses all the weapons of mass distraction by lecturing them  and launches a vitriolic attack on the congress. he tells them how he has changed india since     . the fully trained audience loudly cheers the messiah and chants  modi modi modi .we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowbut there is one thing modi avoids  open press conferences abroad  like he does in india.the local media in those respective countries do not pay much attention to his mass meetings  not even to his hugs and discussions with heads of those states. but the indian media  especially the tv channels  cover his each and every step  from boarding the plane in delhi to landing  to glad handing indians on the street  to mass meetings  to beating the drums  playing the flute and posing for group photographs.his itinerary is followed  minute by minute  by our media although he does not take any media person along with him on his hectic tours. his speeches are shown live in india and then repeated in every news bulletin  in all languages. but modi s laughable factual blunders  gross lies and half truths are cunningly ignored by the media. those are perhaps reserved only for the social media.there are already more books on modi s foreign policy than on nehru s original and creative initiatives. modi is working not only for the present but also for posterity. he wants to leave a footprint on the world geography before he embarks on his second term.also read  before modicare launch  over     children under   are stunted in these poll bound statesnehru s great grandson  rahul  also goes abroad  but of course not as frequently as modi. his speeches or interviews too are covered  but more for alleged gaffes and so called slips. notwithstanding the ridicule and intense hostility  rahul meets media for open q a sessions. so  the media is constantly looking for what they call self goals.since modi never faces the media  he does not have to answer awkward questions. how many times has modi been asked about      after he became the prime minister  rahul can be questioned and even cornered for      anti sikh riots although he was only    then.modi was    years old and the chief minister of gujarat when the      genocide took place under his watch. yet  modi gets a free pass with the media.rahul  on the other hand  is an opposition leader and obviously does not get the saturated media coverage like modi. some of his visits are for  vipashyanas   or psychological inward search rather than changing the world outside.yet  rahul gets juxtaposed all the time with a modi. media enjoys this juxtaposition  which can easily tilt the balance in favour of modi. if rahul is condemned or made to look like a fool or a dimwit  then the intelligent columnists and pontificating commentators are happy. all of them become  well meaning and empathetic  advisers to rahul. they all want rahul to improve. but nobody wants modi even to learn or improve. modi has admirers  rahul has advisers.also read  how many light bulbs does it take to change rahul gandhi this charade will continue till the lok sabha elections in       and even afterwards. with a  congress mukt bharat  slogan

here s why modi gets away with his gaffes  while rahul gandhi gets called pappu
text size  a  a are we applying different standards to modi and rahul there s a clip of a narendra modi speech that made the rounds of social media recently  where the prime minister is talking about converting foul gas coming from a sewer into fuel. the statement became such a butt of jokes that the bjp and its supporters on social media were forced to counter it.had the same statement been made by rahul gandhi  it would have added to the mountain of evidence that mr gandhi isn t a very bright leader  and certainly unfit for prime ministership. why  then  does the same standard not apply to modi  why do modi s gaffes not turn his supporters away from him there s no dearth of gaffes made by modi. he gets history and geography wrong. he indulges in some ludicrous photo ops  seemingly talking to statues in china. he walks around his garden and posts a video of it calling it exercise. he once wore a suit with his name monogrammed on it. he constantly refers to himself in the third person. he says the climate hasn t changed  we the people have changed   whatever that means. not a week goes by without a modi gaffe  and these are just some of the most famous things over which modi has been made fun of.also read  the hypocrisy of rahul gandhi invoking guru nanak in front of nris in berlinyet these goof ups don t seem to impose any political cost on the prime minister. under his leadership  the party keeps winning one state election after another. the worst estimates for      suggest  as of now  that the bjp is likely to emerge as the single largest party but will possibly form a coalition government.even in the      lok sabha campaign  modi made ridiculously tall claims that earned him the moniker of  feku . but this couldn t stop him from becoming the first prime minister with a single party majority in    years.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowby contrast  rahul s gaffes  his goof ups and mistakes all add up to the image that he is unfit to lead the country. not even his supporters are able to say  rahul gandhi for pm . the best they are able to say in his favour is that he d be better than modi because anyone would voices are growing louder on media being unfair to rahul. why does he get called pappu when modi gets away with his embarrassing moments modi s political capitalthe truth is that modi s gaffes hurt him too. humour and ridicule are powerful weapons to undermine anyone s credibility. people have noted that the kind of anti modi jokes that circulate today were unthinkable in     . modi knows this. when modi s favourite word to address the masses   mitron    friends  became a butt of jokes  he stopped using it.yet the reason why modi gets away with his goof ups and why he s still standing tall as a national leader is because he s built himself political capital. modi s political capital has been so enormous that he s even gotten away with a blunder like demonetisation that temporarily slowed down india s economic growth. a few gaffes are small stuff.there are three ways to earn political capital. one is agitational politics  which helped an arvind kejriwal rise from an ngo wallah to a chief minister. the second is electoral  when you win elections  people automatically take you seriously. when you win election after election  beating anti incumbency  you become formidable. the third is administrative. when you are in power  you convince people that your performance as an administrator has been good. you convince at least enough people of this so that they can make you win the next election.also read  modi s ayushman bharat is the jadi booti you mix with your vote and drinkmodi has built his political capital both administratively and electorally. he convinced enough people that he was doing a good job as a chief minister to lead his party through three successive terms in the state. he then convinced enough people that he had a gujarat model of development to be made a prime minister with a single party majority. and then  he convinced enough people that he s helping india progress  which made his party win several state elections.rahul s empty cvby contrast  has rahul achieved anything in agitational politics  or in the electoral arena  or administratively like rahul  his mother sonia also became the congress president only because of her surname. but nobody ridicules her because she helped her party form a coalition government at the centre for two terms.rahul entered politics in      and took it upon himself to revive the congress party in uttar pradesh  but failed in that endeavour. he wanted to revive the youth wing of the party  by launching internal elections  but also failed in this endeavour. he refused to take a ministerial post in the manmohan cabinet  thus losing a chance to build administrative credential.after the congress was reduced to less than a tenth of the lok sabha seats in       it was for rahul to give the party a new lease of life. however  he has failed to defeat the modi led bjp in a single election.also read  how many light bulbs does it take to change rahul gandhi modi s cv says self made prime minister. rahul s cv is empty. that s why the bar for rahul to prove himself is much higher. that s why his gaffes have a higher cost than modi s.during a public interaction in london last week  rahul was asked what his credentials were apart from his surname. gandhi replied   i have been working for       years in the political system. i have taken a beating and have learnt a lot. i am a person who listens  respects other people s ideas. the most important thing to me is that i see through hate. and i really think  i am proud of that. that s no achievement to cite.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in

it is time rahul gandhi and congress stop being afraid of the      question
text size  a  a manmohan singh and rahul gandhi have both done a flip flop on the anti sikh riots.congress president rahul gandhi s remarks in london on      anti sikh riots once again highlight the party s catch    situation over a highly emotive and sensitive issue.interacting with parliamentarians in the uk last week  rahul said   i have no confusion in my mind about that  you say that the congress party was involved in that  i don t agree with that. certainly there was violence  certainly there was tragedy. rahul s recent posturing on the issue is in stark contrast to his statement in january       when he said some congressmen were  probably involved  in the violence against sikhs between    october and   november in     .also read  a bloody miscalculation called blue starin a rapid fire session with news anchor arnab goswami  this is what rahul  who was then the congress vice president  said arnab  were congressmen involved we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers

gone through.arnab  you admit some congressmen were probably involved rahul  some congressmen have been punished for it.manmohan singh s flip floprahul is not the only one in the congress to have changed tack on the issue. in his      lok sabha campaign for south delhi constituency  manmohan singh tried implicating the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh  rss  for the      riots.he described the riots as a  black spot and the saddest event  while interacting with reporters at the press club of india on   september     . he  however  claimed the congress as an organisation had no role in the riots. rather  he pointed fingers at the rss and said that the firs lodged at different police stations proved the involvement of several rss men.manmohan  despite being a frontrunner  lost the fight to the bjp s v.k. malhotra. infighting within the congress and a strong bjp campaign  asking sikh voters to not vote for a party that had  blood on its hands   worked against manmohan.within months of his electoral defeat  manmohan started talking differently. the politician clarified that he had not held the rss solely responsible for the      riots.in december       manmohan said   my statement was twisted for electoral gains. i had said that if there were individuals associated with the congress and other organisations  including the rss  who had taken part in the riots  they should be punished. years later when manmohan  the prime minister  tendered an apology over      killings in the rajya sabha on    august       the rss reference was nowhere.also read  on his death anniversary  remembering the most interesting man i ve met  bhindranwalethe pm instead said he was not standing on any  false prestige  and bowed his head in shame. a somewhat emotional manmohan recalled how he had accompanied congress president sonia gandhi to harminder sahib a few years ago and the two prayed  to give us strength and show us the way that such things never again take place in our country .rahul s dilemmaover a decade later  rahul  congress insiders say  can neither say the      riots were a backlash nor is he in a position to bring the rss in the picture. the rss has already slapped a defamation case against rahul over the congress leader s allegation that it was involved in mahatma gandhi s assassination.privately  a section of congressmen feel rahul seems influenced by liberals and left intellectuals on sensitive matters like      anti sikh riots else he could have showcased manish tiwari and ajay maken as victims of punjab insurgency and post     violence.tiwari s father

the hypocrisy of rahul gandhi invoking guru nanak in front of nris in berlin
text size  a  a for rahul and the congress  liberalism is just a convenient stick to beat the bjp with.congress president rahul gandhi thursday told a gathering of nris in berlin that his thoughts were inspired by the teachings of guru nanak dev  the first sikh guru. the guru spoke of unity in diversity and that s what congress party believes and fosters. what is langar  langar means no one should go back hungry no matter how small or weak   he said at a function organised by the indian overseas congress.a very liberal thought  one would say.but  just look at what his own party s chief minister   captain amarinder singh   in punjab plans to do. the congress government wants to amend the indian penal code to make  sacrilege of all religious texts punishable with life imprisonment .also read  amarinder singh s sacrilege bill shows no indian political party will fight for free speechthose who will be hit the hardest by this change in law include liberals and religious reformers.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowin a country where a few scenes in a semi historical movie based on queen padmavati can lead to mindless violence and threats  the proposed change in law creates room for more social turbulence.but the punjab cm wants to win more seats for his congress party in the      elections  even if that means he has to tread the illiberal path by amending section    a of the ipc.before he pontificates from foreign lands about his liberal values and those of guru nanak ji  shouldn t rahul call up his own party s chief minister and ask him to drop the contentious clause  but  this is politics. what you say and what you do are rarely consistent. expecting rahul to make that call would be too much.forget the chilling impact the amended law could have on rationalists  artistes or on the right to free speech. the obvious fallout will be self censorship for fear of prosecution.it is fashionable to blame pakistan for everything bad that is happening around us. but should we not be doing the opposite of what our neighbour has done through its controversial blasphemy laws misuse of lawin january       comedian kiku sharda was booked under section    a for making fun of self styled godman gurmeet ram rahim singh. ironically  singh was himself booked under the same section in      for hurting religious sentiments of the sikh community by allegedly imitating guru gobind singh   the   th sikh guru.while kiku was bailed out in less than    hours of his arrest  the self styled godman is in jail after a cbi court found him guilty in two rape cases and sentenced him to    years in prison.so  does kiku deserve an apology now there are several instances of publicity hungry lawyers and individuals misusing the process to file cases against known personalities for sedition and under section    a. punjab s proposed law will only increase the vulnerability of citizens if it enters the statute books.also read  amarinder s punjab needs to study these   chilling examples before passing sacrilege billcourts in punjab will be busy dealing with cases like kiku s on a daily basis.a dangerous trendand  it won t be long before the bjp governments in different states also wake up to the potential of political power that such a law holds.in a country where the excruciatingly long process of fighting a case is actually a bigger punishment than the possible sentence  should the citizens of punjab and other states have one more draconian law to worry about what courts saythe spirit of tolerance is a wonderful thing  whose time seems to have elapsed   but liberalism pushes citizens to go beyond mere tolerance. it involves acceptance of others views.rahul and his party  similar to several opposition parties  like to assert their liberal politics and distinguish themselves from the bjp and the rss.but for most of them  liberalism is just a convenient stick to beat the bjp with  immediately dropping it when it suits them.last year  striking down a case under section    a against cricketer m.s. dhoni for allegedly hurting religious sentiments through his portrayal as lord vishnu on the cover of a magazine in       the supreme court reiterated that section    a  does not stipulate everything to be penalised . it doesn t hold that  any and every act would tantamount to insult or attempt to insult the religion or the religious beliefs of class of citizens . insults to religion offered unwittingly or carelessly or without any deliberate or malicious intention to outrage the religious feelings of that class do not come within the section   the bench held.also read  amarinder singh govt s sacrilege bill has history  will be open to misusethe bench was merely following the law laid down by a constitution bench in      in ramji lal modi versus state of up case. the bench had ruled that this section was to deal with only  aggravated form of insult to religion when it is perpetrated with the deliberate and malicious intention of outraging the religious feelings of that class   something that is done with the  calculated  tendency  to disrupt the public order .changing barometermuch before the ramji lal judgment  in       when the central legislative assembly was debating if section    a should be added to the ipc  leader after leader warned of the need to balance bona fide criticism of religion with the need to protect law and order from being disturbed in the name of religion.one member  m.k. acharya  said   even if all the rest of the world should attack my religion  i don t see why i should lose faith in myself and raise any alarm. even m.a. jinnah  the man who fought for india s partition  cautioned against the possibility of misuse   genuine cases of deliberate and malicious intent  must not go unpunished  it must be ensured that  those who are engaged in the ascertainment of truth and those who are engaged in bona fide and honest criticisms of a religion shall be protected .but six decades later  the barometer of what could disrupt public order had changed drastically.in the mid    s  the so called modern  educated and liberal prime minister rajiv gandhi allowed himself to be pushed into taking a retrograde decision in the shah bano case  which till date is cited as an example of the congress  vote bank politics and muslim appeasement.but  maybe  the congress leadership will have a simpler explanation for why the proposed amendment is not a bad idea. the sacrilege bill covers sacred texts of all religions  and is therefore non discriminatory. secularism at its best

how many light bulbs does it take to change rahul gandhi 
text size  a  a a self goal by the congress party s social media team is all the bjp wants.in the visual age we live in  images matter more than words. politicians endlessly produce photographs of themselves where they look like leaders. take narendra modi for instance. almost every day  he produces images that exude power.all images of modi below  unless otherwise mentioned  are from his own twitter account   tweeted by him  i.e.  this is how he wants himself to be seen. these images are powerful because they visualise the abstract idea of leadership and make it seem like a real thing that resides in the personality of modi. if you are a modi critic who scoffs at images like these  think it s not modi but your favourite leader in these images. then ask yourself how you feel.he s waving at his followers. he wears headgear like a boss. his stride is purposeful.world leaders are spellbound by his ideas.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and

and attention.the party is celebrating him like a god all the time.he speaks  others listen.his body language says  i did it .maybe  one is giving him too much credit. he s the prime minister  and the designation alone makes him the centre of attention. let s look at the images he was sharing on twitter in august       exactly five years ago  when he hadn t even been declared a prime ministerial candidate.his body language said he s on the job. he s showing the way.his independence day message sounded like he was already the prime minister  he wasn t waiting to win the election before trying to create  ek bharat  shrestha bharat .it s not clear who s presenting whom a gift  but it looks like a foreign diplomat is showing modi respect.he was giving succour to those who need it. or  the images he shared suggested as much.he was already guarding india s borders occasionally  he does go overboard   but only in trying to look like a boss. kya khoob lagte ho  bade sundar dikhte ho

country.these images put out by the congress party s official twitter account thursday suggest the opposite of leadership. they make him look clueless.maybe rahul is not clueless  but he looks clueless. whatever rahul says in germany is now going to be overshadowed by these images  which have become the stuff of a million memes. the memes suggested the photos make him look awkward and uncomfortable   not the sort of person anyone would want to see as a prime minister.me when i fart in the elevator pic.twitter.com  vlbcd upw   harish iyengaar   scaryhairyman  august         many on

happy ending  karan leeches off of his father s business and lives a lazy lifestyle. however  upon watching an action movie  he and some friends decide to enlist in the army  only to decide halfway through the course that it is too much for them. this decision costs karan the respect of his family and lover  so he resolves to return to the army and prove his resilience. that s not all. the congress puts out more images making him look aimless  clueless and amateur.will you ever see modi or the bjp ever put out a picture where his own party colleagues look like they are not interested in him  how do you make someone look like a leader if you make him look like he stands aloof  while his followers are busy in their own casual chit chat how many light bulbs will it take to change rahul

gdp numbers have become phallic symbols for congress   bjp
text size  a  a the broader india story does not shine as much as the gdp numbers. but there is no one capturing and presenting the larger picture.the manner in which the two leading political parties got into a tizzy over some new numbers on the growth of gross domestic product  gdp   put out by a government appointed committee  is instructive. the congress was over the moon because growth during its period in office was posted as being about a half percentage point more than previously reported. the government s response was to come back with a riposte on the costs of that growth.it would seem that the rate of economic growth has become every government s choice of phallic symbol  never mind that all calculations of gdp are but someone s opinion of the facts. the calculations are numbingly complex  with all manner of  sometimes arbitrary  assumptions made in order to arrive at the final number. especially in an economy like india s  where the unorganised sector of the economy is the preponderant one  whatever gdp growth number is put out is at best a rough approximation. so  .  per cent could well be   per cent  and the other way round. it is plain silly to get into political slanging matches over such decimal points  especially since the basic narrative is pretty much what it was earlier  the second congress alliance government could not sustain the growth rate of the first  and the second bjp alliance government has not been able to accelerate.also read  nothing wrong with gdp data showing better growth under upa  says economist behind reportduring the long decades when india s growth rate was underwhelming  there was good reason to focus on getting the rate up to what other economies had achieved. growth  after all  is the best antidote to poverty as validated by the faster reduction in poverty numbers during the years of rapid growth. but having achieved rapid growth on a sustained basis  though  admittedly  not rapid enough   it is time to recognise that gdp  roughly  national income  is only one measure of performance. there are plenty of others like what has been happening to national assets. just as the income expenditure statement of a company needs to be read together with its balance sheet of assets and liabilities  so it is with the economy.in the week after the kerala floods  it hardly bears pointing out that an obvious example of mismanaged assets is the country s natural resources  water  forests  etc. you can grow income while depleting finite assets  as india has been doing  for a certain period of time  but not forever. india is running out of water  while continuing to deplete other natural resources such as forests. why aren t the government s statisticians enlightening us on changes in the economy s balance sheet  in addition to telling us about national income there are other assets such as human capital and institutional capital. what is the performance on health and education  by general reckoning  not as good as the performance on gdp. as for institutional capital  which in some ways is the most important of all  most people would agree that some key institutions are being run down in terms of their social capital  corruption in the courts  suborning of criminal investigation agencies  the autonomy of universities and the quality of university appointments  the operating freedom of the press  and much else.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will

between rich and poor  a society s fault lines come under greater strain. the geographical inequalities are particularly stark  bihar s per capita income is a fourth of the southern states   and uttar pradesh s less than a third. is this a sustainable situation  do the gaps in incomes and opportunities explain why there is more vigilante action  i.e. lawlessness  in some of the  bimaru  states than elsewhere  won t the loss of social cohesion translate into economic disruption of one kind or other the broader india story does not shine as much as the gdp numbers. but there is no one capturing and presenting the larger picture  such as to provoke debate the way the gdp numbers do. if the narrative has to go beyond plain growth of income  our statisticians need to focus on the country s balance sheet of trackable assets as carefully as they track changes in income.by special arrangement with business standardsubscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis

congress is not anti obc. one rajiv gandhi speech is used to cancel out all pro quota steps
text size  a  a the congress  politics of late has put special emphasis on the other backward classes. when the party won the assembly elections in madhya pradesh  rajasthan and chhattisgarh in december       it appointed two chief ministers from the obc category   ashok gehlot in rajasthan  and bhupesh baghel in chhattisgarh. congress  general secretary priyanka gandhi vadra has become dependent on obcs in uttar pradesh s politics. in her state team of one party president and five vice presidents  two belong to the backward classes and one to a scheduled caste. meanwhile  congress president sonia gandhi wrote a letter to prime minister narendra modi  stating that the obc category is not being given the benefit of reservation under all india quota for the national eligibility cum entrance test.historically  the congress has been considered to be against reservations for backward classes. rajiv gandhi s lok sabha speech in september       in which he opposed the mandal commission s report  has been referred to time and again in this context.considering this  it is important to understand whether the congress has been actually against backward classes or reservations. that the congress has not been opposed to obcs and reservation for them can be inferred from the following arguments.constitutional amendment for reservationthe first amendment to the constitution of india came in     . in tamil nadu  there were some court judgments that held reservations as against article       of the constitution  which accords every citizen the right to equality. the courts also cited article        which states that no citizen can be denied admission in any educational institution on the basis of religion  caste  community  or language. it was argued that granting reservation was against the rights granted to minorities under article    of the constitution.india s first prime minister jawaharlal nehru introduced the first amendment and dispelled this confusion. article        was appended to the fundamental rights  in which it was clarified that this article or article        did not go against the provisions made for the benefit of socially and educationally backward classes  scheduled castes and scheduled tribes. nehru s statement in parliament on    may      illustrates this.it should also not be forgotten that the constituent assembly  which had introduced the system of reservation into the constitution  had the largest number of congress members.also read  rss in       sc in        quota row hits bihar polls again but

backward classes commission  constituted under the chairmanship of journalist and social reformer kaka kalelkar. according to article     of the constitution  the kaka kalelkar commission was formed on    january     . the commission presented its report on    march     .discussions about the report went on for six years  until it was rejected in     . in reality  the kaka kalelkar commission had only one member of the backward classes commission   barrister shivdayal singh chaurasia  who wrote an    page note of dissent. the upper caste members of the commission wanted to select other backward classes on the basis of their economic condition.chaurasia believed that since discrimination had been perpetrated on the grounds of caste  the identity of backward classes should also be established on the basis of caste. there was so much controversy over the report that kalelkar wrote a script that led to the suspicion he was not in favour of the implementation of the report.after that  jawaharlal nehru decided that state governments should identify backward classes at their level  and give them appropriate facilities to bring them into the mainstream. not long after  in       nehru passed away. so  it cannot be said that nehru was not a supporter of obc reservation. it was based on the constitutional amendment made in      that states implemented obc reservation  and the

mandal. by the time the commission could prepare its report  the janata party government had collapsed.election was held and the congress came back to power  with indira gandhi as prime minister. she neither dissolved the commission nor obstructed their work. in fact  during indira gandhi s term  the tenure of the commission was extended twice   once from april   to    september       and again from october   to    december     . the commission submitted its report to congress leader and home minister giani zail singh on    december.b.p. mandal expressed gratitude towards indira gandhi while submitting the report. there was no debate on the report. it cannot be denied that indira gandhi managed to get the report prepared during her term in office. however  it is also true that the report

promise  the national front government led by vishwanath pratap singh implemented the recommendations of the mandal commission. this was debated in parliament.rajiv gandhi  as the leader of the opposition  opposed the implementation of the report. he alleged that there were several factual flaws  and called the report incomplete. however  this had little impact. all the leaders of the congress who belonged to backward classes  including sitaram kesri  hailed the implementation of the mandal commission report outside parliament. the case went to the supreme court. election was held in      and the congress formed the government under the leadership of p.v. narasimha rao.the government appealed before the supreme court  which ruled in favour of reservations on    november     . the congress government issued a notification on   september      regarding the implementation of the report. the delay was caused by the time taken to set the parameters for the identification of the creamy layer  which the court had decided to exclude from the obc reservation.those standards were flexible till now. but the narendra modi government is preparing to change this  such that a large section of obcs can only get jobs on the basis of their economic conditions  while giving    per cent reservation to upper castes.also read  reservation not a fundamental right  sc on plea for obc

central educational institutions.following a court case  the law eventually came into force  paving way for the admission of oppressed groups in all well known universities of the country  including the indian institute of technology  iit   indian institute of management  iim   all india institute of medical sciences  aiims  and jawaharlal nehru university  jnu . the congress had to face a lot of

modi shah aping divide and rule of congress. same fate awaits bjp
text size  a  a there isn t much the narendra modi amit shah led bharatiya janata party needs to learn from the congress in its current avatar  given it has raced past its rival  both politically and electorally  and it also enjoys a clear lead in the perception battle. however  modi and shah seem to have picked up one big lesson from the congress  playbook   the divide and rule policy.the factionalism and infighting in many bjp state units   from karnataka to madhya pradesh to assam    subtle or otherwise  continues unabated  and the party s top two seem happy to allow these rivalries to simmer. this has been an old congress trick   the top leadership  read the gandhis  likes to keep the leaders under them at loggerheads with each other  thus  rendering them dependent on the blessings of the family  making sure nobody poses a challenge to them while they cement their own position.modi and shah have chosen the same strategy. they are way too powerful and much in control of the party to not be able to quell internal bickering and read the riot act to the warring factions. if internal frictions persist  it isn t despite the powerful two  but it is because of them.modi shah duo  however  forgets  or choose to ignore the big lesson   this strategy yields short term gains but hurts in the long run. congress  freefall can be attributed to this approach  which may have helped the gandhi family rule luxuriously  but also ensured a worrying degree of decimation of the party.also read  bjp didn t acquire scindia just for power. it s also to keep shivraj singh chouhan in checkfrom madhya pradeshthe bjp is well ensconced in power at the centre  with modi s popularity continuing to soar and shah s election brain helping the party reap electoral dividends. and yet  their insecurity of power is such that they are more than pleased to preside over a host of internal battles.look at madhya pradesh. it was a state the bjp lost in      by a whisker  but its top leader shivraj singh chouhan continues to remain popular there  and the party even swept the      lok sabha election. the bjp s central command  however  decided to jump at the opportunity of bringing in a sulking jyotiraditya scindia from the congress amid much fanfare  well aware how it would translate into an uneasy relationship between him and chouhan. months later  chouhan was shown his place  scindia was given what he wanted and modi shah ensured they added a generous dose of fuel to this fire of rivalry. the central leadership could have dealt with this delicate issue more sensitively  and ensured that neither side had a reason to complain   easier said than done  but not impossible for two men who take pride in their ability to control the narrative.we are deeply grateful to our

while the former belonging to the cm s camp. the factionalism in karnataka came out in the open when a group of leaders complained to the central leadership about how chief minister b.s. yediyurappa

decision to overrule his candidates suggestion for the rajya sabha polls.in gujarat  the vijay rupani nitin patel rivalry is now old news. and in rajasthan  the internal factionalism ahead of the

temporary purpose   of ensuring there is no challenger. after all  modi himself reached delhi after serving as a state cm for many years  and eventually  displacing all other top leaders  including veteran l. k. advani.but such a strategy makes the organisation vulnerable in the long run  and for anybody wanting to leave behind a legacy of a strong organisation  this can hardly be the plan. by

modi s chest thumping ministers  and not congress  are an irritant in dealing with china
text size  a  a at the height of the doklam stand off in july       a powerful functionary of the prime minister s office  now a retired ias officer  called up a senior journalist of a leading english newspaper. listen  you guys are unnecessarily playing up doklam stories on the front page every day. it s a matter of national security   the bureaucrat told the journalist. when the latter argued that it was unfair to expect the media not to report what was happening in doklam  the pmo officer snapped   but it can be a single column on some inside page. why is it a front page story every day  do you want to play with national security  also read  it s time for china  pakistan  even india to rethink the fantasy modi called expansionismrestraint during doklami can t share the rest of the conversation or what happened after that. it would be unfair to the source of this information. but this telephonic talk gives a glimpse of how the narendra modi government wanted to play down the seriousness of the doklam crisis to prevent the ever ready jingoistic brigade from scuttling the dialogue process.then external affairs minister sushma swaraj had told the rajya sabha that patience and bhasha sanyam or restraint in language was very important to resolve the stand off.  even after war  there has to be a dialogue. so have dialogue without a war   she had said.there was also a tight leash on the bharatiya janata party  bjp  warriors who had to stick to the briefs given by the government  basically  no chest thumping on camera. it turned out to be a prudent and successful strategy.also read  from nathu la to galwan  india has been trapped in reaction mode to china s aggressionwe are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions.

prime minister narendra modi had launched  surgical  and air strikes to punish pakistan in      and       his ministers are now outdoing him in pounding china with one verbal strike after another.communications and it minister ravi shankar prasad thursday declared india s  digital strike  through a ban on    chinese apps.  we will not make any compromise on bharat s integrity  bharat s sovereignty and bharat s security   he thundered. the next morning came the  thermal and solar strikes  from power minister r.k. singh who announced that india won t import equipment from china. highways minister nitin gadkari struck with a road roller  declaring no chinese companies will be allowed in highway projects in india. gadkari s deputy  general vk singh  retd   had already given a clarion call   let s hurt them economically. other things will follow.  in tv studios  bjp warriors are not tired of reminding everyone of the      debacle and of how modi is not jawaharlal nehru.addressing the bjp s virtual rallies  home minister amit shah has been reminding people of surgical and air strikes against pakistan to emphasize that pm modi is  unlike previous pms  and anybody who encroaches india s border will be punished.also read  rahul gandhi has skipped all    meetings of standing committee on defence since septemberhow nehru succumbed to war hysteriaso  what has changed since doklam  is it the seriousness of the violation of the line of actual control by the chinese army  economic retribution against china is  of course  one of the options to many strategic affairs experts who recommend to make china see reason and back off. but union ministers thumping their chests everyday runs the risk of whipping up war hysteria. unless  of course  these ministers know what we don t that the pm has made up his mind to exercise military options to push back the chinese intruders.as theprint s editor in chief shekhar gupta noted in episode     of  cuttheclutter  in       then pm jawaharlal nehru s decision to go to war with china at a time when he knew the army wasn t ready was made under heavy public pressure. nehru s decision was made out of exasperation because he was harassed by his critics to go to war.in       modi is also facing flak from the opposition congress that is daring him to expel the chinese intruders even at the risk of a full fledged war. it sees in the lac stand off an opportunity to divest modi of his usp or the unique selling proposition his assiduously crafted image as a strong and decisive leader.but is the congress  onslaught credible enough to make the prime minister insecure  there is no evidence as yet to suggest that people are losing faith in modi s current strategy of military and diplomatic negotiations to resolve the crisis at the lac. as per an ians cvoter snap poll    .  per cent people trust the modi government on national security issues  as against   .  per cent who trust the opposition. many of us take such surveys with a pinch of salt but this one doesn t sound counter intuitive.as asim ali and ankita barthwal  research associates at the centre for policy research  wrote in an article in theprint  the bjp so strongly owns the issue of national security that it s unlikely to face any political consequences of the government s  blunders  in dealing with china unless the lac standoff escalates further.also read  as india china face off again  late brig dalvi s      memoir a reminder of all that went wrongmodi needs to see beyond domestic politicspm modi has no compulsions to react under pressure  as nehru did. the first time the opposition seemed to get under his skin was when he impulsively dismissed any chinese intrusion at an all party meeting. he has recovered fast. he would rather communicate directly with the people  instead of indulging his critics and getting caught in specifics. on friday  through his address to the soldiers in ladakh  he sent out a firm message to an  expansionist  china and thus allayed the concerns of his happy to be gullible constituents who needed some talking points.going further  the prime minister needs to be totally unencumbered by domestic political compulsions as he focuses on india s strategic response to china s daredevilry. that s where his ministers  as also the economic nationalists in the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh  rss   may end up tying him in knots. in their zeal to show off india s ability to hurt china economically  they may end up creating war hysteria  in which  boycotting chinese goods and banning chinese companies is not good enough. for the modi era  patriots    surgical  and cross border air strikes are the new yardsticks and they would expect no less vis   vis china.these chest thumping ministers may end up driving the prime minister into a corner where india s strategic options get tied to his political image. if that happens  the country as also the bjp may find itself in uncharted waters.views are personal.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis   only you can fix it you are reading this because you value good

the fundamental flaw in priyanka gandhi s uttar pradesh strategy
text size  a  a shaktisinh gohil  congress leader from gujarat  is the party s bihar and delhi state union in charge. rajiv satav of maharashtra is in charge of gujarat. similarly  a. chellakumar of tamil nadu is in charge of the goa unit  and so on.this mechanism makes sure that the central leader in charge of a state has an outsider s view  does not have stakes in the local system  such as aspirations to hold political office in that state   and  as an outsider  is unable to overshadow a leader from that state.this idea goes for a toss when priyanka gandhi becomes the uttar pradesh in charge. she goes a step further and increases our confusion by taking to public campaigning in the state. if one is a voter in uttar pradesh  one is left wondering  who is the party s chief ministerial candidate  priyanka gandhi or state president ajay kumar lallu news of priyanka gandhi moving to lucknow has been appearing and re appearing seasonally like the monsoons. just like priyanka gandhi entered politics after years of speculation  we have now learnt over and over again of sheila kaul s house in lucknow being renovated for the congress state in charge. in a way  the congress way of doing politics is very lakhnavi  cooking a slow dum biryani  while the nawabs play chess.also read  priyanka gandhi to move to lucknow after vacating govt bungalow in delhi  congress leadersdivide and ruleif and when priyanka gandhi does move to lucknow  it will probably be as ceremonial a move as her once in a blue moon visit to the state organised so badly the cameras can t even capture her. the move to lucknow now looks like a best possible reply to the narendra modi government taking away her lodhi estate bungalow. but will priyanka gandhi actually spend more time in uttar pradesh than in delhi  so far she hasn t shown that she s willing to make such a sacrifice on her time with family and friends in delhi.ceremonial or real  priyanka gandhi will definitely spend some time in gokhale marg as the uttar pradesh assembly election come closer. february      is now less than two years away. the harder priyanka gandhi works for it  the more people will wonder if the party s face is gandhi or lallu we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowto be sure  this question will only bother those in uttar pradesh who have some interest in the congress party. and that s not too many people. for all the media hype that priyanka gandhi and yogi adityanath generate by taking on each other  up      is   as of now   largely a yogi vs akhilesh contest  bharatiya janata party vs samajwadi party.this is why the bjp is happy to give attention to priyanka gandhi. it wants to pretend its main competition is the congress  so that the anti bjp vote  especially the muslim vote  remains firmly divided between the samajwadi party  sp   the bahujan samaj party  bsp  and the congress. this will make sure the bjp wins the election even if its vote share comes down due to anti incumbency.yogi versus who in such a situation  if any of the three opposition parties   sp  bsp  congress   want to have even a semblance of a chance at defeating the bjp  they have only one option. a strong presidential style campaign that makes it clear to every voter that the election is about deciding who s better cm material  yogi or akhilesh  yogi or mayawati  yogi or ajay kumar lallu as is obvious  the weakest possibility there is ajay kumar lallu. he s a grassroots leader  but even if he has the potential to become a popular statewide face  the looming shadow of priyanka gandhi won t let him.there is thus no option for priyanka gandhi but to state in as many words that she is the congress party s chief ministerial candidate in uttar pradesh. if she fails to do that  then despite yogi s best efforts to promote her  the congress party will still get fewer seats than the largest bus in rajasthan.by having her communist student leader aide tweet about up in shuddh hindi  she can make media headlines but it doesn t get the congress party any traction in the streets of up. by declaring herself as the cm candidate  priyanka gandhi will send out a strong message to voters in the state that the congress party is serious about up. that is what it will take for up voters to even start thinking about the congress as an option.priyanka gandhi as a declared congress cm candidate  spending at least five days a week in up  will be yogi adityanath s dream come true. he will do his best to make sure the state s political conversation is all about yogi versus priyanka. the bsp and sp will be sidelined to the extent that voters won t be able to tell who the bjp s main opponent is.also read  congress has split into three parties  and not one of them is good at politicsno guts  no glorypriyanka gandhi s hesitation in declaring herself a cm candidate would be the risk. if she fails  the congress  brahmastra  will officially be declared a damp squib. yet if she doesn t declare herself the cm candidate  she s going to fail anyway.the congress party has been winning around    odd seats in the state assembly since       until      when it dipped to  . that is where it is likely to stay with the gandhi or lallu confusion. for all that she s investing in the state  priyanka will then be declared a failure at par with brother rahul. remember  rahul gandhi had also taken it upon himself to  revive  the party in the state when he first joined politics.if priyanka gandhi campaigns as a cm candidate  many might want to give her a chance just out of curiosity. this will

madhya pradesh s new cabinet shows that a slow  congressisation  of the bjp is happening
text size  a  a new delhi  the newly formed madhya pradesh cabinet signals the  congressisation  of the bjp  theprint s editor in chief shekhar gupta said in episode     of cut the clutter.an analysis of the cabinet  and where the loyalty of its members lie  shows that mp chief minister shivraj singh chouhan has been cut to size. in fact  he has been rendered a lame duck who s also been kneecapped.fourteen of the    cabinet members are former congress leader jyotiraditya scindia s loyalists  they had defected to the bjp with scindia back in march. this means more than    per cent of the people  who aren t even members of the house yet  have been made ministers.three others are loyalists of bjp s narottam mishra while three are loyalists of the party s national general secretary kailash vijayvargiya. this leaves just    ministers who are actually cm chouhan s loyalists  which means he has very little space to do or say anything.but it isn t just madhya pradesh which is showing these signs. of the    nda ruled states  bjp has its chief ministers in     but a closer look reveals a slow move towards a complete  congressisation  of the bjp.for one  this indicates the rise of a high command culture in the bjp  just like that of the congress. only one person or a couple of people own that high command space   similar to how the congress is presently run by just a few people  such as rahul gandhi and sonia gandhi.this also shows that the bjp now has very weak cms as well as cabinet ministers. this is because all the power within the party emanates from one source.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowbjp s once formidable cms brigadeone of the main reasons why prime minister narendra modi came to power with such a resounding mandate in      was due to the fact that the bjp had built very strong chief ministers who could always swing elections in their states for him. but six of these strong cms are nowhere to be seen now.former rajasthan cm vasundra raje is out of power as is former chhattisgarh cm raman singh.gujarat had narendra modi as its powerful vote catching cm  but his shift to delhi moved that power with him. in maharashtra  nitin gadkari  who could swing elections single handedly  has now been sidelined.in madhya pradesh  chouhan has also been sidelined  cut to size and rendered powerless despite being the cm.on wednesday  at the swearing in ceremony  he cryptically commented that  amrit  nectar of immortality  comes out of the churning of the ocean as shiva consumes vish  poison    in what may be a metaphorical reference to himself.trend catching onother bjp ruled states signal a similar trend. the formula of keeping your chief minister reduced to a nobody who gets instructions from delhi for anything he wants to do is being repeated in all the states.for instance  assam s cm sarbananda sonowal is seen to have very little power. in fact  it is the health minister himanta biswa sarma who is considered the face of the assam government. he is also seen as the face of the bjp in all of the northeast. he won the northeast for the bjp.in haryana  manohar lal khattar has had to share power with his deputy and jjp leader dushyant singh chuatala  after the two parties were forced to form a coalition government. cabinet minister anil vij too occupies a very important  powerful position in the state government.in gujarat  cm vijay rupani is remote controlled from new delhi  which is a well known fact.manipur cm biren singh was forced to restore the portfolios of his deputy cm  national people s party leader y. joykumar singh  as part of the understanding reached between union home minister amit shah and the npp delegation led by its national president and cm of neighbouring meghalaya  conrad sangma.this means that while singh may be the cm  the real authority and power lies with the high command in delhi.in karnataka  b.s. yediyurappa s authority has been undermined time and again  most recently when none of his rajya sabha nominees were selected by the party high command  which instead backed those of yediyurappa s rival  b.l. santosh.the one exception to this rule is uttar pradesh cm yogi adityanath. he was seen as a political lightweight with no real following of his own. but the fact is that the way adityanath has conducted himself has not only made him more of a hindutva brand ambassador but also a brand ambassador for modi and shah. he wasn t chosen to be an exception  but just turned out to be one.watch the full episode here subscribe to our channels on youtube

   years before kerala floods  mahatma gandhi blamed caste system for natural disasters
text size  a  a kerala is better equipped to rise anew from the calamity than any other part of india.when s. gurumurthy insinuated that the kerala flood disaster was somehow related to allowing women into the sabarimala temple  he revealed a failing that afflicts even mahatmas in india.gandhi blamed untouchability and caste discrimination for the earthquake that struck bihar in       causing a famous exchange of letters and a civilised but public disagreement with rabindranath tagore. tagore chastised gandhi for promoting superstition. gandhi remained unapologetic  claiming that even if he was wrong to suggest that human conduct had caused natural disasters  as long as it was for a good cause   fighting untouchability   it was justified. clearly  the mahatma s belief in the supernatural outweighed his own professed philosophy of ends not justifying the means.but tagore wasn t the only one who chastised the mahatma. guess who said the following  there was a massive earthquake in lisbon in the   th century. the religious leaders of europe preached to the people that the earthquake was the result of the protestant perfidy against the religious beliefs of the roman catholics  it was in reaction to these reasons that the people decided to protect themselves against future earthquakes by trying to finish off the protestants.such naive people were incapable of even understanding that there were physical explanations for earthquakes  let alone trying to use seismology to design machines that could perhaps help them predict the risk of an earthquake. europe could truly embrace the machine age only when its religious beliefs were demolished by the scientific approach.but in india  even someone as influential as gandhiji swears by his  inner voice  to say that the bihar earthquake is a punishment for the caste system. and that he is still waiting for his inner voice to tell him why quetta was rocked by an earthquake.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowand then there are shankaracharyas and other religious leaders who swear by the religious books that the earthquake was caused by attempts to do away with the caste system.what can one say about the religious naivet  of the ordinary people in a country when its prominent leaders hold such views  europe is in the year      while we are in the year     . these are the words of vinayak damodar savarkar  the intellectual fountainhead of hindutva.also read  what would have happened to mahatma gandhi in the times of cambridge analytica and facebook i must thank niranjan rajadhyaksha for translating savarkar s marathi article in the magazine kirloskar  wherein  he argued that india would continue to lag behind europe as long as its leaders believed in superstition rather than science . savarkar certainly wouldn t approve of his modern day followers adopting gandhi type superstitious beliefs.savarkar distilled the general point about the lisbon earthquake  but he seems to have confused the details.after the portuguese capital was struck by a devastating earthquake on all saints  day in       the catholic religious establishment put forth the view that the disaster was divine punishment for human sin. this angered the marquis of pombal  the portuguese king s reformist chief minister at that time  who had set upon rebuilding the city with steely determination.pombal went after the jesuits who got in his way to the extent of  ironically  setting the inquisition on them and burning gabriel malagrida   a prominent pamphleteer who d championed the divine punishment theory   at the stake. pombal carried out reforms that brought portugal into the age of enlightenment  modernising education and industry  while rebuilding the city s ruined infrastructure.also read  in kerala flood war room  clockwork efficiency is the order of the daypombal was no doubt a ruthless autocrat  but he is relevant to the current flood crisis in kerala. no  not the bit about burning propagandists at the stake  but rather the bloody minded focus on the task of rehabilitation and rebuilding.  what now  we bury the dead and feed the living   goes an apocryphal quote attributed to him. pombal did more than that   he used the reconstruction as a fulcrum for national transformation.today  as we despair about the enormity of the calamity that has struck kerala  we can take heart from the empirical evidence that shows natural disasters can improve long term economic growth. the crisis and its immediate aftermath will indeed be painful  the human and economic losses severe  and the post crisis management challenges immense. yet  kerala is better equipped to rise anew from the calamity than any other part of india.that s because of its high level of human development  physical capital may well be destroyed by the flood  but the immense human capital that the state enjoys is relatively unscathed. it also has good social capital to rely on. with the right kind of post crisis reconstruction framework  kerala can aspire for higher levels of prosperity and human development.also read  can india have a liberal mass hero ever again in a landmark cross country study over    years  mark skidmore and hideki toya found that natural disasters can have a positive impact on long term economic growth  and one standard deviation in climatic disasters raised annual economic growth rate by  .   per cent. in another important study  aaron popp found that natural disasters affect economic growth through  technology  human capital accumulation  physical capital accumulation  and the natural resource stock. all four macroeconomic variables help increase long run growth . post crisis recovery  therefore  should promote these ingredients of growth. healthy recovery needs good institutions that  again  kerala can justifiably boast of.no study of such a nature can be conclusive. nor is it a given that positive effects will kick in over the long term. even so  this knowledge offers us encouragement in our moment of distress. for  while the moral conduct of humans has little to do with natural events  it is entirely within our power to come out better and stronger from our misfortunes.nitin pai is director of the takshashila institution  an independent centre for research and education in public policy.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a

unlike indira gandhi  this is why modi era isn t producing strong new foes
text size  a  a arun jaitely  ravi shankar prasad  nitish kumar  lalu yadav  sharad yadav  mulayam singh yadav  ram vilas paswan  sitaram yechury  and prakash karat   all these leaders have one thing in common. their political birth was during the resistance to emergency. if narendra modi s government since      is as draconian as his critics allege  can we name a leader of similar political stature who emerged in the last   years the threat to democracy today is surely no less severe  in fact it s probably more dangerous. in the words of yogendra yadav  our democracy has been  captured  and our first constitutional republic has already ended. yet  you wouldn t know it from the state of our opposition  which is a picture of fecklessness and passivity. what explains this dearth of opposition leadership  particularly the almost complete absence of new leaders  and at a time when we need it the most two big reasons stand out.also read  how bjp has owned the national security issue and why china won t change thatpeople being patient with modiwhen the emergency was declared  indira gandhi was already getting unpopular  eight years into power. the gujarat and bihar agitations against corruption  misgovernance and price rise were going on for nearly two years  signalling widespread sentiment of alienation from the government. many young leaders latched on to this already growing sense of anger that culminated in the jp movement  to launch their political careers. but today  the popular consensus seems to be that modi must be given more time to reverse what he has framed as  sixty years of misgovernance . given the scale of his ambition  to build a  new india   people are willing to give him more leeway  reflected in the scale of his second electoral mandate.second  there was the organisational backing of the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh  rss   which provided an army of resolute cadres that formed the backbone of the anti congress movements. being the only mass national socio political organisation in the country  its footprint can be found in most of the large political mobilisations at the national level  from ayodhya to the anti mandal movement to the anti corruption movement. without organisations  there are no movements  the wellsprings of new political leadership. the opposition today lacks such an organisation.the scale of the opposition failure in leadership merits a deeper analysis. we identify six reasons for this failure  four supply sided  the failure of the political system to produce effective opposition leadership  and two demand sided  there is no popular appetite for energetic opposition leadership .we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowalso read  india s young no longer charmed by modi. blame economy and ideologywhere the opposition couldn t deliverfirst  there are no comparable movements of large groups today acting as a conveyor belt of political talent. the anti citizenship amendment act movement was of limited scope and did not throw up any significant political leader. the four biggest youth leaders to have emerged over the last six years chandrasekhar azad  jignesh mewani  hardik patel and kanhaiya kumar are still confined to narrow pockets of influence  and do not pose a significant challenge to the modi government.second  existing political parties have become sclerotic and undemocratic  making it very difficult for  non dynastic  young political talent to emerge. interestingly  all of the young leaders cited above  except kanhaiya to an extent  have emerged outside of any party structure. there are no strong young leaders such as atal bihari vajpayee or lal krishna advani who came up the ranks of their organisations and resisted the emergency. the congress party hasn t held meaningful internal elections for the top posts since the time of indira gandhi. regional parties formed around caste language lines  rjd  sp  jd  s   dmk  have ossified into single family bastions. the last big movement that birthed a genuinely mass political leader was the india against corruption movement that gave us arvind kejriwal.third  it s difficult for new mass leaders challenging the modi government to emerge from the politicisation of existing cleavages. the bjp has adapted to the three decade old mandal movement by deftly side lining caste cleavages in the political discourse through calculated re engineering of caste affiliations. modi and amit shah have managed to undercut the appeal of opposition obc leaders  like the yadavs  by appealing to non dominant backward castes. they have employed a similar strategy with dalits  pitting dalit sub castes who had been excluded from political and social power against the relatively powerful dalit sub castes like jatavs.in other words  there are no longer any broad cleavages to ground clear and potent political narratives of oppression. an increasingly large number of young members of backward castes are moving away from this narrative of oppression to a narrative of aspiration and hindu unity. there is no fresh  young talent in these tightly controlled family run mandal parties to bring back these sections with a reimagined political narrative. contrast this with the bjp. by side lining the old guard  like advani  kalyan singh  murli manohar joshi   who had depleted their political capital and replacing them with leaders like modi and yogi adityanath  the party has re energised hindutva with the politics of aspirations  welfare and law and order.fourth  it took a leader of the stature of jayaprakash narayan to bring all the ideologically diverse opposition parties under a common platform of  anti  congressism   both in the jp movement and in the resistance to the emergency. jp was widely respected by everyone  and drew his enormous popular legitimacy from the independence struggle as well as having rejected a cabinet berth in the nehru government. there is no one in the present congress leadership  or outside  who has the authority to similarly coalesce the opposition into a united anti bjp platform. sonia gandhi has receded from active politics  and rahul gandhi can hardly be counted upon to seriously lead his own party  let alone a united opposition.also read  covid lockdown has ended only opposition politics in india. bjp s shop is very much openmodi enjoying the legitimacy of popularityapart from these supply side factors explaining the dearth of political leadership  there are certain demand side impediments.first  unlike the emergency  the formal processes of a democracy have been left intact by the modi government  thus preventing the opposition leaders from effectively conveying the seriousness of the situation to a largely indifferent public. for instance  the act of voting  something that is considered sacrosanct and universally accorded a high degree of importance  has not been rescinded. many ordinary citizens might not concretely feel the restriction of abstract freedoms in their everyday lives  as long as they see external processes of democracy regular and competitive elections  campaigning  freedom to vote all running smoothly on the surface.second  the present moment doesn t feel as urgent or alarming simply because the prime minister enjoys a great deal of popular legitimacy. thus  unlike the naked power employed in the emergency  which was seen as coercive and illegitimate  the resounding mandate and popularity of the present government lends a veil of legitimacy to even constitutionally questionable or undemocratic actions of the government. there is no alienation and disaffection of a large segment of the public as was seen in the upsurges of the mid   s. since the modi government enjoys this level of credibility  the public is not looking for new alternative leaders who can act as vehicles for their resentment.for the health of a democracy  the absence of a credible opposition force represents a moment no less alarming than that of the outright suspension of democratic rights. our democracy is not dying from the bludgeon of an emergency  but from the slow poison coursing through its veins.asim ali and ankita barthwal are research associates at the centre for policy research  new delhi. views are personal.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis

rajiv gandhi and his wife need certain comforts  indira had told a friend
text size  a  a rajiv gandhi became prime minister at    without any ministerial experiencerajiv gandhi would have turned    today. there are no full length biographies on him till now. but here are some interesting aspects related to rajiv s personal and political life  culled from various political biographies.  when rajiv gandhi was sworn in as the prime minister  barely hours after his mother indira gandhi s assassination on    october       he was chosen by a nine member congress parliamentary board  cpb . but in effect  only two members   p.v. narasimha rao and pranab mukherjee   did the honours  and not all nine. the parliamentary board had four vacancies at that time  and two members were not in delhi. indira gandhi  who was the sole ex officio member of the cpb  was dead. as per article xxv of the congress party constitution  the parliamentary board is the supreme authority for selection of party nominees for the lok sabha and state assemblies  regulating and coordinating all political activities  and framing rules. curiously  the board has been defunct since the death of rajiv in may     . successive aicc chiefs narasimha rao  sitaram kesri  sonia gandhi and rahul gandhi have not bothered to constitute it for the fear of accountability before a powerful party forum.also read  who really influenced rajiv gandhi to act against shah bano judgment   rajiv addressed the

needle of suspicion had been pointed at rajiv  singh  in his memoirs  published posthumously by hay house        titled a grain of sand in the hourglass of time  an autobiography  put the blame of anderson s escape on narasimha rao who was the union home minister at that time. he claimed that rao  through union home secretary r.d. pradhan  had instructed state chief secretary brahma swaroop to let anderson go.  i came to know later that the union home secretary  r.d. pradhan  upon the instructions of the union home minister p.v. narasimha rao  had telephoned brahma swaroop  state chief

there is new aggression in us congress to check trump   russia before election season
text size  a  a both parties in washington are united against russia after trump administration s failure to commit to election security measures.it has become now obvious to national security experts in the united states that the kremlin has no intention of scaling back its efforts to interfere with the us  democratic process and that the trump white house has not been invested in protecting the us from russian meddling in the      midterm elections.as the us heads to the elections for the senate and house of representatives this fall  bipartisan zeal has been on display to ensure that russia is kept in check. this comes soon after the embarrassing summit between president donald trump and vladimir putin  during which the former appeared to take the word of russia over his own intelligence

grudgingly and yet  disappointingly  the administration has done little to implement it.to add pressure  the us congress introduced the defending american security from kremlin aggression act of      earlier this month. it would increase economic  political  and diplomatic pressure on russia as a push back on its continued interference in us elections  malign influence in syria  and aggression in crimea  among other activities. in particular  the bill includes restrictions on new russian energy projects  sovereign debt transactions  uranium imports  and additional sanctions on russian

inspectors for on site inspections and reassures the us that it will no longer use chemical weapons.why is all of this important first of all  it is a welcome development to see bipartisan solidarity in the wake of the administration s failure to commit to midterm election security measures for most of      and     .senator graham echoed the sentiments of many in his chamber of congress when he acknowledged that  the current sanctions regime has failed to deter russia from meddling in the upcoming      midterm elections   and that he planned a  sanctions bill from hell  to punish russia. while it is still unclear what the bill s prospects are for passage this fall  congressional aggressiveness seems to be prodding the white house to get out in front on the russia file. the administration is reportedly drafting an executive order that would authorise president trump to sanction foreigners who interfere in us elections.also read  india us relations survived world war

international inspectors  the trump administration will face an important decision in    days  which will be on or around election day.given the political firestorm surrounding the russian interference storyline  it is anyone s guess how president trump will approach this. thus far  the trump administration has had an extremely poor record of implementing sanctions against russia. as max bergmann and james lamond noted in foreign policy earlier this year  the administration s willingness to implement the sanctions has long been in doubt. from the very beginning of the trump administration  it sought to remove sanctions on russia. when congress first took up the legislation  the administration said new sanctions were unnecessary and lobbied against the bill. when its passage looked inevitable  the administration pushed to water it down. and when congress passed the sanctions nearly unanimously  the president grudgingly signed the bill into law  letting the world know he thought it was  seriously flawed.  then  in october  the administration missed an initial implementation deadline.true enough. there is a new hope  however  that the present pre election moment featuring national concern over election vulnerability offers a moment for action. whether through congressional legislation too popular for trump to scale back through executive manoeuvres or the white house attempting to reshape the  who s tough on russia  narrative and take back the russia reigns from congress  this fall could wind up producing tangible results whether trump really wants

on up s political turf  a new rivalry is unfolding  mayawati vs priyanka gandhi
text size  a  a the world this year has witnessed many unexpected situations unfold  and the world of politics is no different. the bonhomie at display between congress president sonia gandhi and bahujan samaj party chief mayawati hugging each other on stage at the swearing in ceremony of then karnataka chief minister h.d. kumaraswamy in may      has turned into a turf war for uttar pradesh where mayawati and priyanka gandhi vadra are at loggerheads.also read  not just mayawati  these are the unsung women who led kanshiram s bahujan strugglemayawati s new found strategymayawati s bahujan samaj party  bsp  is facing an identity crisis  but the former uttar pradesh chief minister refuses to go down despite no second rung of leadership in sight without a fight. she s chosen priyanka gandhi vadra as the object of her wrath to change her political fortunes. attacking the top congress leader from gandhi family  in a way  makes her an ally of the bharatiya janata party  bjp  and also gives political observers the chance to analyse her past association with the bjp. mayawati had taken the bjp s support  which essentially holds the upper caste hindu vote bank in the state  to form government in uttar pradesh in     .with the bsp s dismal performance in the      lok sabha election  mayawati quickly accepted the dominance of the bjp in uttar pradesh. she didn t squeak a word of displeasure when bjp usurped bsp s      slogan of  sarvajan hitay sarvajan sukhay   for the welfare of one an all . the slogan is significant because mayawati won the      uttar pradesh assembly election by bringing the brahmin and dalit voters together. priyanka gandhi  too  is out to woo the same voter base. mayawati feels the competition  and is therefore  not letting go any opportunity to attack priyanka gandhi.be it her soft stance at all party meeting on the modi government s handling of the lac crisis with china  or her praise for the uttar pradesh government s efforts to bring back labourers  mayawati is cosying up to the bjp.that s not all. mayawati chose to stay away from the all party meet that congress president sonia gandhi had convened in may to discuss the covid    situation.also read  yogi govt scared  undemocratic  priyanka hits out at up congress chief s continued arrestwe are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowpriyanka knows it tooseen in the context of a future alliance with the bjp  all this makes perfect sense. bsp is trying to halt congress from making significant inroads in uttar pradesh under the leadership of priyanka gandhi.and priyanka gandhi realises this all too well. last week  while responding to the uttar pradesh government s notice to her over her comments alleging that two girls were found pregnant at a child shelter home in the state  priyanka gandhi asserted she is  indira gandhi s granddaughter  and won t shy away from speaking the truth against the yogi government  unlike some  undeclared bjp spokesperson like some of the opposition leaders . this was a veiled attack on mayawati.priyanka gandhi s optics of gender is also playing out well. till now  mayawati was the only powerful female leader in uttar pradesh setting things straight in a state that s infamous for its patriarchy. but now  there s priyanka gandhi too  who is not only taking to the streets  going house to house to meet people  but is also dodging cops to show her fearlessness while reaching out to the people to gain some brownie points. in december last year  priyanka gave the uttar pradesh police some anxious moments when she met retired ips officer s.r. darapuri  arrested in lucknow for his participation in anti citizenship amendment act protests.priyanka had in august last year staged a dharna after she was stopped from meeting the sonbhadra massacre victims. she wears her fierceness and challenges her rivals with aplomb. on being asked if the yogi government was threatened by her on ground presence  she had categorically stated that  everybody s politics is in danger.  that  everybody  includes mayawati.also read  its up chief ajay lallu in jail over bus row  but congress is making little noise about itdigging up old gravesmayawati has gone full throttle in calling out priyanka gandhi every time she moves a muscle. in january  she accused the latter of shedding  crocodile tears   saying that she visits every other place in uttar pradesh  but has no time to see the situation in congress ruled rajasthan. she was referring to the death of     infants at a government hospital in kota.in february  mayawati again attacked priyanka s  theatrics  and her visit to the ravidas temple in varanasi. she said that the congress had never honoured ravidas during its rule in uttar pradesh.the new found rivalry has continued even during the pandemic. when priyanka gandhi offered       buses to the uttar pradesh government to ferry stranded labourers back home  mayawati was quick to pin the blame of the migrant distress on congress  saying its previous governments had not developed rural areas of the state  leading to the migration of farmers  dalits and tribals to big cities in search of livelihoods.it isn t hard to decode mayawati s political messaging when seen in the context of the bjp s statements  which had also attacked the congress for its past failures.this political one upmanship only led to further pain for stranded labourers when the uttar pradesh government refused to use most of the buses offered by the congress  declaring them unfit for travel. this  while migrants were hiding in crammed trucks and cement mixers to reach home.the uttar pradesh assembly election is another two years away and the political development there is anyone s guess. but mayawati s special attention to priyanka gandhi is indicative that priyanka is doing something right  politically of course.the author is a political observer and writer. views are personal.subscribe to our channels on youtube

china s time is over. bjp congress only need to see the current crisis through as a team
text size  a  a prime minister narendra modi s all party meeting on the ladakh stand off with opposition leaders last week went more or less on predicted lines. while there was a show of solidarity at the meeting  a lot of muck has been thrown by the bharatiya janata party and the congress at each other since  be it in tv debates or through statements in the media. the political discourse in india cannot be allowed to descend to the level of one upmanship between the country s two major national parties. saner elements in both camps will have to bury the hatchet and work as a team to forge a new strategy not only to tide over the current crisis but also to face possible challenges in the future  especially as china is unlikely to back down.it is a great relief that india s entire political establishment has so far spoken in one voice. except when communist party of india  marxist  general secretary sitaram yechury dug out the hackneyed panchsheel and asked the modi government to  strictly  follow it. perhaps the cpi m  should try to use its influence to give the chinese leadership a few lessons on panchsheel. the  five principles of peaceful coexistence  that india and china signed in       four years after the chinese annexation of tibet  is as irrelevant today as the communist parties.adhering to the idea of panchsheel unilaterally notwithstanding       dealt a severe blow to india s image  strategy  soft power approach  and unwrapped the border issue with a new map. three years later  we had a hostile china breathing down our neck and an aggressive pakistan waging a war against us. but just six years after that  a strong and determined leadership under then prime minister indira gandhi broke the back of pakistan  consigned the  two nation theory  to the dustbin of history  and sent strong signals to china and the us right in the middle of the cold war. but the dreaded emergency  declared on    june       became indira gandhi s undoing  derailing what could have been a great strategy to catapult india on to the centre stage of global politics.also read  china playing victim after attacking indian soldiers at galwan. delhi must not fall for itchina

new power on the block  began unveiling its regional and global strategy. speaking at the nazarbayev university  kazakhstan  in       chinese president xi jinping said   we do not seek to dominate regional affairs or establish any sphere of influence. we stand ready to enhance communication with russia and all central asian countries to strive to build a region of harmony.  since then  china has created a sphere of strong influence in the region encircling india  and its rise has been far from harmonious.nearly three decades later  both india and china are again at the place where they began their journeys. on the one hand  the standoff that surfaced in ladakh region is showing no sign of resolution. on the other hand  unconfirmed claims of massive military build up on both sides of the line of actual control  lac  suggest that the standoff is likely to linger on for the next few months. just as people are being advised to learn to live with the deadly covid    pandemic  india will have to learn to live with the chinese threatening the line of actual control  lac  and its aftermath as well. but india isn t alone. in the wake of the pandemic  beijing s hegemonic approach seems to be afflicting several other countries  belying the fa ade of  china s peaceful rise .china s much touted  peaceful rise  was supported on two legs   military modernisation and economic clout  giving beijing all authority and no responsibility. china s internal assessment about its future strategy is a continuation of its centuries old core beliefs. the chou empire zhonghua  the middle kingdom  established in the northern plains of china  truly believed that it was at the centre of the earth  ordained by the gods to vanquish the barbarians all around. when mao zedong stormed into the citadel of power in      with his communist warriors  china once again became zhonghua renmin gongheguo  middle kingdom people s republic   or people s republic of china.we are deeply grateful to

at     i joined the protest against indira gandhi s emergency  spent   months in jail
text size  a  a today marks a black day in post independence india. citizens who witnessed the period of emergency      june      to    march        cannot forget those horrifying days of complete anarchy  dictatorship and censorship.the indira gandhi government unleashed terror  systematically denouncing every democratic institution  and compromising the judiciary. many so called freethinking intellectuals and academicians surrendered themselves to her authoritarian rule.in those tough times  it was unthinkable to raise one s voice against the government. but as protests engulfed the country  some young followers of the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh  rss  who could not bear the agony of this stifling silence also joined in. i was one of them  the youngest of the lot. i was    years old and a class   student of bharatiya vidya bhavan in new delhi. i decided to fight the state s might through the gandhian tradition of satyagraha  a non violent way of defying all that is not good for the country.also read  this is no emergency. modi and shah are using democracy to subvert democracyit s citizens  democracyabraham lincoln had said that democracy is  by the people  for the people and of the people  and without civil society keeping a strict vigilance  it will never remain  ..of the people . my experiments with democracy began very early  i value freedom to the exclusion of all other things in life.whatever the shortcomings of jawaharlal nehru  he must be credited for building india s institutions. but indira gandhi was an authoritarian who undermined all democratic institutions in the country one after another. in       when the allahabad high court nullified her election for the use of unfair means  she imposed emergency and suspended all democratic rights  including the fundamental right of free speech. to my fresh and young mind  this was unacceptable. i wanted to break the shackles of all bondage imposed during the emergency.all political activities  with most political leaders in jail across the country  had come to a standstill. there was fear all around. terror of the government had imposed superficial discipline on everyone. propaganda of efficiency  law and order  and discipline was baffling and press censorship led to complete disconnect of the people with the reality.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time

loud sounds of beating from the adjoining rooms. i had heard so many stories of  third degree  atrocities of the police  and in those moments  that was all i could picture.we stayed in those cells for about    hours. the toilet in the same cell was partitioned with a small  shoulder height wall. it was very unhygienic and smelly. next day  we were taken to the magistrate  i was sent to a prison meant for children but it housed adults too  some of whom convicted for crimes such as rape and murder. other members of my group were taken to tihar jail. this was a big jolt for me  because i was left all alone.i was made to share a dormitory like setup with criminals  and had to sleep on the ground. we were given blankets from the common pool. in the morning i was allowed to use common toilets  which were extremely dirty. i had to wear a jail uniform that had been used by others  and i was made to do everyday chores such as cleaning and washing with other prisoners.during my three month stay in the jail   from    november      to    february        i could not once meet my parents. my mother was arrested and kept in tihar jail  and my father   a professor at lady hardinge medical college who was arrested on    december       was initially kept in tihar jail and later shifted to nagpur central jail. i was arrested under defence of india rules  dir   which we used to call defence of indira rule.occasionally  a counsellor would come to meet me and coax me to sign the mafinama  pardon letter   saying it would help in my release and that i was wasting my time

isolation and seclusion of the jail and the horror of staying with criminals was a nightmare beyond the comprehension of ordinary people. the uncertain future was always creating a fear of the unknown  but standing for a cause and upholding democracy was a strong motivation.our case went on until the new government was formed and was finally withdrawn in late     . until that time  i had to go to the court every week to attend the hearing. my parents  case was referred to the shah commission  which was set up to take note of the emergency atrocities.those formative years and the experiences

rahul gandhi s      choice between mamata   mayawati depends on who is his mother s friend
text size  a  a even die hard congress enthusiasts are unsure of rahul gandhi s ability to edge out narendra modi led bjp in     .mamata banerjee or mayawati  congress circles are weighing various options between two women politicians to head the opposition mahagatbandhan against the bharatiya janata party  bjp  in      general elections.the speculation around these two names comes just three months after rahul gandhi  the president of the congress party  said in bengaluru that he is ready to become the prime minister if the party emerges as the winner. but even die hard congress enthusiasts are unsure of rahul gandhi s ability to edge out narendra modi led bjp in     .between mamata and mayawati  it will finally come down to the question of personal proximity and political symbolism. the comfort level of    janpath with the west bengal chief minister is high  but congress members from the hindi heartland prefer mayawati because the dalit icon can enhance their winnability from panchayat to parliament.also read  mamata and congress sink differences  decide to fight      polls togetheras per conventional wisdom  mamata should be the preferred choice for the congress. she is an ex congressperson and closest to the grand old party ideologically. over the past two decades  despite several political realignments  mamata has stood by    janpath.sonia gandhi was not in active politics on the night of    december      when mamata walked out of the congress   or was rather expelled from the party. sonia had made special efforts to keep mamata in the congress parivar. she pleaded with former aicc chief sitaram kesri to keep mamata in and even opened the doors of    janpath at midnight for a last minute meeting.we are deeply grateful to our readers

sonia that she owed everything to rajiv gandhi but could not stay in the congress because of pranab mukherjee  who was heading the anti mamata faction in the congress.  page     in sonia  a biography

in march       mamata had started enjoying being the supreme leader of the breakaway group.sonia s affection for mamata was visible when the two hugged as soon as the latter was sworn in as an nda minister at rashtrapati bhavan on    october     .  congratulations   sonia said   but will you come back   both realised the invite was just an emotional gesture.  page     in sonia  a biography

she expected both sonia and rahul to be at her swearing in ceremony. but the mother son duo skipped the event on the grounds that  national leaders  do not go to swearing in of state leaders and allies.this hurt mamata  especially because it was pranab who had advised sonia against going to kolkata. but now  congress old timers wonder that had rahul gone  bengal and national politics would have been different.a section of the congress  however  views mayawati as someone more effective and  solid  than mamata to lead an anti bjp alliance. despite the absence of personal rapport   although sonia and mayawati glued their heads together for a few moments in a public display of affection at h.d. kumaraswamy s swearing in ceremony in may   her caste background and the massive dalit following that she commands gives an advantage.dalit support for the congress at the national level will help the grand old party bounce back  some say  and will help counter the sangh ideology more effectively. average congressmen from the north and central india want the revival of the party s old template of brahmin muslim dalit voters that kept it in power for decades.also read  mayawati

eyes of bsp ideologue kanshi ram. mayawati returned sonia s goodwill gesture by voting against atal bihari vajpayee government in april      when it fell short by a single vote in parliament. sonia

biography  penguin      sonia mayawati bonhomie  however  did not last long. in       mayawati accused sonia of deceiving poor villagers and orchestrating a campaign to starve india s most populous state of funds and development. the congress responded angrily  accusing mayawati of indulging in  dirty politics  and spreading a  pack of lies .the determining factor between mayawati and mamata is electoral dividends. while mamata s trinamool is certain to pick up the bulk of    lok sabha seats from west bengal  the same cannot be said about mayawati s bahujan samaj party  which currently has zero representation from home state  uttar pradesh  in the   th lok sabha. but her dalit politics is likely to help the congress get support from many allies and smaller parties across india.also read

r.k. dhawan stood by sonia gandhi when no one else did
text size  a  a sonia  who had seen r.k. dhawan serve the gandhi family from close quarters  had reasons to be indebted to him.two years ago  congress president sonia gandhi was meeting senior party leaders at    janpath when she suddenly turned to r.k. dhawan and asked   so you are also writing a book . dhawan was speechless and his book  an autobiographical account  was shelved. this was a time when m.l. fotedar  natwar singh  salman khurshid  pranab mukherjee  margaret alva and a host of other congress leaders had written books and memoirs that had caused embarrassment to sonia and the party.in october       dhawan had gone public saying he was  inclined  to write a book that would  reveal a lot  about former prime minister indira and her son rajiv. dhawan had told ritu sarin of the indian express   my book will not be like that of natwar singh  which says nothing. it will reveal a lot. this is because i strongly feel a leader should not appoint any friends or relatives to posts like that of a minister. this is the mistake rajiv gandhi made with the likes of arun nehru  arun singh and m.l. fotedar  all of whom poisoned him against me. dhawan  addressed as rkd in party circles  was a curious mix of a die hard nehru gandhi family loyalist  a gatekeeper and an executioner who installed and removed duly elected chief ministers of congress ruled states  almost at will. he was  dhawan saab  for many rich and powerful who wanted to get an audience with indira.in the initial years  indira s steno typist shot to fame for being the prime minister s messenger. in the early     s  indira used to avoid giving direct instructions to her ministers  chief ministers and state party heads. dhawan was her conduit to convey unpleasant and often awkward decisions. the game plan was that if things go wrong  dhawan would get the blame. this arrangement placed great power in dhawan  the henchman.also read  how indira gandhi gifted indian democracy a new generation of political talent by jailing itdhawan is credited with spotting sanjay gandhi s political ambitions. the young man was back from crewe  uk  after an internship at rolls royce. as indira s personal assistant  pa   dhawan started introducing sanjay to congress bigwigs. he started advising some congress leaders to praise sanjay in indira s presence. within months  indira was somewhat convinced of sanjay s political acumen  and by the time emergency was imposed  dhawan was enjoying the confidence of both mother and son.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions.

had managed to shift union home secretary n.k. mukherjee out and replace him with s.l. khurana  then chief secretary of rajasthan. a core team consisting of junior home minister om mehta and bansi lal was in place to ensure that electricity supply to newspaper offices was cut on the night of    june      when emergency was declared.however  post emergency  dhawan tried to distance himself from the excesses committed during the period. he had told author coomi kapoor   the real culprit of the whole emergency was s.s. ray. afterwards  he  ray  tried to disown responsibility  and put the blame for everything on indira in the shah commission. dhawan has been quoted by kapoor in her book the emergency  a personal history as saying that during the shah commission hearings  ray once went up to indira and remarked   you are looking fit . she replied coldly   you are doing your best to keep me fit . she never spoke to him again . ray  like so many of those who were party to the emergency excesses had  post march       tried to deny his involvement and pin the blame entirely on sanjay and mrs gandhi .the thakkar commission of inquiry into the conspiracy angle in indira gandhi s assassination  however  was a huge setback for dhawan. the report that was selectively leaked in the indian express pointed the needle of suspicion at dhawan. rajiv  who was the prime minister and the congress president  did not waste any time in removing dhawan from all the key posts and positions.for years  dhawan would visit the hanuman temple at baba kharak singh marg in delhi  seeking divine intervention. by       bofors and the exit of arun nehru had shattered rajiv politically  and dhawan was back in favour.sonia  who had seen dhawan serve the family from close quarters  had reasons to

signalled by the mighty maratha and executed by the diminutive samurai with a swish of his razor sharp tongue. sonia and the rest of her council were stunned.as recounted by those present at the meeting  sangma slowly built a case for how the bjp campaign against sonia s foreign origins was seeping down to even remote villages. then came the unkindest cut.  we know very little about you  about your parents   sangma told her.those present at the meeting claim that sonia was shocked by sangma s bluntness   sangma was drafted into the cwc as her nominee.  when people ask us why the congress has failed to get a qualified indian among  india s      million citizens as its prime ministerial candidate  we have no answer. i think they are right   sangma said.pranab mukherjee  manmohan singh  jitendra prasada  madhavrao scindia  rajesh pilot  ahmed patel  ghulam nabi azad  arjun singh  ambika soni and other  loyalists  kept hearing sangma till dhawan lost his cool. he

this battle. we are all with you .congress insiders had told this correspondent then that dhawan s act of loyalty had left a deep mark on sonia. she had kept wondering why the likes of scindia

rahul gandhi needs to learn from rss if he has to defeat bjp
text size  a  a rahul gandhi has turned out to be more conventional and much less imaginative than his mother sonia gandhi in his politics.in the run up to      lok sabha elections  the bjp s prime ministerial candidate narendra modi would tell his party workers that  badlaav ki aandhi   storm of change  was blowing but they should not hold the cycle tube aloft and expect it to be filled with

badalti hai to kuchh kaam nahin aata  when the wind changes its direction  nothing works . what happened to the india shining campaign in        he said  dismissive of the bjp s preparations on the

the opposition party caught in a time warp. except the replacement of the old clique with a new one  congress president rahul gandhi has turned out to be more conventional and much less imaginative than his mother and predecessor  sonia gandhi  in his politics.he is trying to emulate her      strategy to defeat the bjp in     . if she managed to overcome atal bihari vajpayee s popularity and charismatic appeal by cobbling up alliances with regional parties  he would do the same    years later. if she picked up jairam ramesh to oversee the party s poll preparations in the war room  so would he. if her narrative was centred around socio economic deprivations in rural india  so would his. copying the mother s political tactics is not necessarily a bad strategy  but the only problem

aside his views about the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh  rss  and study how it works on the ground to help the bjp   that is if he does not see the tireless efforts of modi and his ministerial and party colleagues making any impression on the people.in poll bound madhya pradesh  the rss observed swami vivekananda day from     january by organising  run for awakening bharat   elocution and painting competitions  and speeches by  eminent personalities  in     colleges and educational institutions. in vidisha  a jagran was organised in which over        people reportedly participated. the rss

by ignoring obcs for party positions  bjp would repeat congress  fatal mistake
text size  a  a share of upper caste vote within the bjp s hindu social coalition has continuously declined over the past two decades.in a fascinating study of the bharatiya janata party s  bjp  organisational structure  a team of journalists at theprint found that upper caste politicians occupy nearly two thirds of the positions within the national executive  and as state and district unit presidents. should this worry the bjp leadership  scholars of political parties argue that organisations in their expansion mode often develop contradictory tendencies or internal pressures  which if not dealt adequately and in time may become a reason for its degeneration.also read  we analysed       bjp leaders   found the party remains a brahmin baniya clubthe bjp  it seems  is undergoing a similar phase. while the social base of the party now consists of more voters from the lower rungs of hindu society  its leadership positions largely remain the preserve of few. scholars distinguish between three different faces of a party  the party in public office  the party in central office and the party on the ground. the public office element deals with government and legislative aspects  central office deals with party platforms and leadership  and the ground element deals with party activists and the electorate.these three elements  although largely overlap with each other  serve different purposes. this organisational perspective also helps in understanding the internal and external environment in which a party operates.traditionally  the bjp s support base has been mainly among the hindu upper castes. in the late     s  the emergence of new political formations  articulating the interests of the other backward class  obcs  and dalits  forced the bjp to realise that if it intended to expand electorally  it too must become responsive to the leadership ambitions of these groups. k.n. govindacharya  the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh  rss  ideologue  theorised the effort of promoting backward caste leaders as  social engineering . this new political strategy helped the bjp make electoral gains in several parts of the country  and the party became a principal player in many states of northwest india. but the backward caste upsurge in the bjp turned out to be a short lived affair due to the attempts at tightening the upper caste grip over the party under the leadership of atal bihari vajpayee.the      election not only consolidated the bjp s traditional support among the upper castes  but also managed to attract a large number of voters from the obcs  dalits and adivasis. this electoral upswing marked the highpoint of slow transformation that was taking place within the bjp s vote base. as evident from figure    the share of upper caste vote within the bjp s hindu social coalition has continuously declined over the past two decades. it also becomes evident that the bjp is undergoing a process of mandalisation. the obc vote constituted the largest component within the total vote secured by the party. in fact  the share of obc votes has surpassed the vote from the upper castes. the share of scheduled caste  sc  and scheduled tribe  st  votes within the bjp s social coalition too has increased.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to

castes and    to the scs and the sts. this ratio was very different two decades ago  when of every     votes among hindus     came from the upper castes     from the obcs and only    from the scs and the sts.also read  why theprint is wrong about the bjp being an upper caste partywhile the profile of the typical bjp voter has changed dramatically between      and       the caste profile of bjp parliamentarians has largely remained the same  see table   . two thirds of the cabinet ministers belong to the upper castes  which is highly asymmetrical to the extent of support the party receives from this social section. moreover  almost half of the non upper caste cabinet ministers belong to the bjp allies  and not the bjp. the scenario is not very different if one looks at the caste background of chief ministers in the bjp nda governed states.the biggest challenge before the bjp  therefore  is the mismatch between the altered electoral support base of the party consisting primarily of the obcs  dalits and adivasis on the one hand  and the largely unchanging social character of its leadership on the other. the party would do well to recall that the congress party s failure to accommodate the aspiring leadership among various non upper caste communities in     s led to its gradual decline. the representational blockage impelled the leaders from the emergent intermediate and lower castes to leave the congress. they had to either form new parties  mostly regional in character  or join other parties in search of power and position.if the bjp continues to remain the preserve of the upper castes and does not align with the democratisation of its support base  it is bound to become a major source of tension within the party in the coming years.the writer

india s socialist leaders warned china was bigger enemy  but both bjp and congress ignored
text size  a  a india s foreign and strategic policy is obsessively focused on pakistan. but the latest incident along the line of actual control is just one more proof why our focus should have always been on china first   our primary competitor and adversary. successive governments  whether led by the congress or the bjp  kept the pakistan bogey at the centre of their south asian policymaking  ignoring consistent reminders from india s socialist leaders to shift the attention towards the bigger threat  china.none were taken seriously. and now we have a nuclear power in our neighbourhood that we mostly remain clueless about on how to deal with  even as new challenges   from economic to territorial   continue to arise  the latest being the ladakh incursion.so  who are

india learnt the wrong lesson from      china war. modi govt must be more openthe farsighted politiciansa firebrand socialist leader  ram manohar lohia             was one of the few voices who would repeatedly caution prime minister jawaharlal nehru about china  especially when the euphoria around  hindi chini bhai bhai   india and china are brothers  was developing after china s annexation of tibet in     . lohia wanted a confederation of india and pakistan   and had even signed a joint statement with deen dayal upadhyaya in april        to counterbalance the might of china  whose

himalayas is not in national interest  in fact  it can create a lot of problems for us in the near future . he also said in indian politics   there is reluctance to face the reality that china s

s enormous financial and military strength means it will always remain a bigger challenge. moreover  the contemporary and medieval history provide ample evidence about china s expansionist policies  which are playing out in ladakh once again.and just as past governments ignored the socialist leaders  china centric concerns  the bjp government led by prime minister narendra modi appears further away from that position  mainly because its politics   and thus policies   is shaped by hindu muslim binary  which pakistan fulfils far more effectively than any other design or method possibly could.but such an approach not only manifests in advancing the legacy of ignoring critical voices  it also takes our asia policy away from the china threat and closer to scenarios where we are backstabbed by beijing.there is no denying that india s inimical relation with pakistan has had a huge role to play  shaped as this relation is by both the events of the past and present. during the later days of freedom struggle  the congress and the muslim league had turned bitter towards each other   a legacy that continued during partition  entered the kashmir conflict and shaped future india pakistan ties. and with the two countries always at war   overt  covert or ideological   it became a natural corollary that both pakistan and india tried to align with china.that is the genesis of the warmth and thaw in india china relationship. but history bears testimony to how that thaw was short lived. china showed its true colours  and india lost a large swath of land in the eastern theatre in     . the galwan river valley  which is part of the eastern ladakh  was successfully held on to at the time.also read  india can t free ride others to limit china. it needs to lead the containment

several decades.over the past six years  pm modi has met chinese president xi jinping as many as on    occasions. the bilateral trade between the two countries has soared to new heights  and chinese

philosophy nor the  jhoola diplomacy  can hide.the one thing that can bring a change   and reduce the intensity of  shock  india experiences every time china shows its real face   is linked to direct realisation of what ram manohar lohia  mulayam singh yadav and george fernandes had said long ago. it s time india made a course correction and turned its foreign policy gaze primarily towards china.

trolled  abused  mocked  bullied   rahul gandhi offers a window into battling mental health
text size  a  a the untimely death of bollywood actor sushant singh rajput has ignited a fresh debate around mental health in india. the news about the    year old actor s death by suicide left the country in shock. many have since dwelt upon sushant s depression  bullying and behind the back gossiping in bollywood. people have blamed producer karan johar and his gang for insulting the actor over the years.the inner workings of bollywood groups that often comprise a select few   the star kids  the  close ones    might not be known to everyone. but their devastating impact on people considered  outsiders    from small towns  from the tv industry   routinely figures in media interviews  personal posts or through  leaks  from friends. this culture of separation and continued mockery may be an outcome of personal insecurities  but it almost certainly doesn t take into account its effect on people at the receiving end. in such a scenario  it might be helpful to look at those who are able to deal with the never ending barrage of abuse  insult  bullying  mockery in a systematic manner.in india s social media swarmed by it cells of political parties   whose members mostly comprise anonymous trolls   several public figures are made targets on a daily basis. from rana ayyub  swara bhasker  mohammed zubair to arundhati roy  barkha dutt  and countless others  a set of people are constantly at the receiving end of bullying and abuse. but if there is one public figure who is the target of not just anonymous trolls on social media but even anchors on tv channels  it is congress leader rahul gandhi.also read  no one in bollywood killed sushant singh rajput. only the silence dida permanent targetfor close to a decade now  the nehru gandhi scion has been at the centre of a concerted propaganda that targets and distorts everything he says or does. there is no better proof of this than his condolence tweet for sushant singh rajput  which was photoshopped to change the word  actor  to  cricketer . and thousands bought into it. but this isn t new.since that infamous arnab goswami show six years ago  rahul gandhi has had to face non stop venomous comments and slander. recently  the it cell trended an abusive hashtag targeted at his mother  congress president sonia gandhi. and it s not just the twitter or facebook trolls or fake whatsapp forwards where rahul gandhi is made a target  even leaders such as home minister amit shah repeatedly refer to him as  pappu .bjp leaders  communally divisive and stupid remarks rarely make it past some criticism on social media but even a fake tweet attributed to rahul gandhi reaches mainstream news and has to be later debunked. rahul gandhi has to be the butt of all jokes. but pm modi can get away with his  cloud benefit  theory  or the india canada ties producing   ab  similar to a mathematical formula. piyush goyal can attribute discovery of gravity to albert einstein. bjp leaders can quite comfortably eulogise the benefits of gaumutra  cow urine  and gobar  cow dung . mp giriraj singh can proudly declare that his constituency begusarai in bihar has begun conducting     coronavirus tests a day    about four and a half months after india reporting its first case  and in a district with a population of    lakh. congress leader shashi tharoor too can share fake news. but rahul gandhi is the target of all mockery.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowunder the established modus operandi used for rahul gandhi  his statements are exaggerated and distorted to suit the agenda. bjp s sambit patra repeatedly shares or uses a  aloo sona  clip  which leaves out the part where rahul gandhi was using that reference to describe modi s remark. and so  something that was said by modi is now widely credited to rahul gandhi. that s how the  system  works. it is for this reason  perhaps  that amit shah can confidently ask what rahul gandhi has done during the coronavirus crisis  because clearly it s the congress leader  and not shah  the union home minister  who assumes the charge of the country when a crisis hits.also read  most suicide helplines are of little help as they don t work when people need thembattling mental healthit s difficult to comprehend what keeps rahul gandhi going. when people such as amit malviya  the head of bjp s it cell  began to tweet messages on mental health and depression in the wake of sushant singh rajput s death  a lot of people shared their stories of mental trauma and being pushed into suicidal state by malviya and his team s incessant targeting  which involved a barrage of abuses and threats while sharing their family members  photographs or personal details.journalist karnika kohli  who detailed her experience of being trolled and abused by the it cell with thousands of messages in       had to ultimately deactivate her account soon after she posted the messages. several others have detailed similar experiences. congress leader salman nizami is one of them  saying he was  almost pushed to die . people s slide into depression and developing other mental health issues is common when bullying and trolling goes past a person s capacity to respond or shut out the targeted attacks.rahul gandhi s public life doesn t appear to be shaped by the propaganda against him. he hasn t reacted to the insults and trolling. when he did acknowledge it  he did it to show how the attacks have only made him  much stronger .on  teachersday i thank all those from whom i ve learnt  over the years   that includes the army of social media trolls  some journalists with an agenda   my political adversaries  whose vicious barbs  false propaganda   anger has taught me a lot   made me much stronger     rahul gandhi   rahulgandhi  september        on numerous occasions  he has said that he doesn t have hatred for anyone. he hugged pm modi in parliament  which left the latter befuddled. unlike modi s      interview with karan thapar  where he didn t answer pointed questions and left midway  rahul gandhi completed his      interview with arnab goswami despite the latter turning into a visible bully. in another college conference in       rahul gandhi was  booed  by the audience but he didn t reject them and accepted it with humility.perhaps  it is his composure and refrain from attacking his opponents in a similarly venomous way that keeps him grounded  no matter the criticisms heaped on him. because the slander against him is unending and could easily take away a person s peace of mind. he is often mocked for taking breaks from politics but perhaps it s good for him and his mental health.it s time for india to accept    inch chests won t help us overcome our increasing mental health burden.views are personal.subscribe to our

unmaking the modi mythology bit by bit is rahul gandhi s strategy for     
text size  a  a by attacking his brand  the congress risks turning the next elections modi centric.the congress party s ceaseless diatribe against prime minister narendra modi may appear cynical  but there is a well thought out strategy behind this  diminish  brand modi  and the mythology around it.the personality cult of modi has been built around broadly seven attributes  a strong and decisive leader   vikas purush  or development man   na khaoonga  na khane doonga  or someone who doesn t indulge or brook corrupt practices   hindu hridaya samrat  or someone who rules hindu hearts   garib maa ka chaiwalla beta  or the tea seller son of a poor mother  a backward caste leader whose politics transcends caste affiliations  and  oratory.the congress has been seeking to chip away each of these attributes to undermine this brand  a sine qua non in its attempt to dislodge the bjp from power at the centre and in states. take a look at how the principal opposition party is trying to achieve this objective.strong   decisive leader  in the run up to the      lok sabha elections  the bjp repeatedly raised the issue of  dual power centres   hinting at then upa chairperson sonia gandhi s interference in the government  to project then prime minister manmohan singh as  weak . the bjp s narrative was effective as the congress led regime was accused of policy paralysis. it faced allegations of scams  seemed to be under siege from within  and was projected as weak kneed in its dealings with other countries  especially pakistan and china.it was in this backdrop that the bjp successfully projected modi as a strong and decisive leader. the congress has been attacking modi for  inaction  on many fronts   from not reining in radical elements and scamsters to  keeping silent  when  china is in doklam  building a road   as party president rahul gandhi said. the opposition party is also seeking to create an impression that the strong leader is  in fact  arrogant who does not keep even his cabinet colleagues informed about his decisions concerning their ministries and hates those who question his decisions. rahul s hug to modi in the lok sabha was meant to buttress that impression.vikas purush  modi showcased the gujarat model of development and promised to replicate the same across the country ahead of the last general elections. the prime minister now claims that india has progressed more in the past four years than it did in over six decades since independence. rahul and his party colleagues have been seeking to puncture modi s india shining narrative by citing dismal job growth figures  adverse impact of demonetisation  suicide by farmers  fuel price hike  falling rupee  among other issues.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowna khaoonga  na khane doonga  the clean image of modi has been one of the strongest points of the ruling nda  especially as central investigation agencies have been charging opposition leaders for alleged acts of omission and commission virtually on a daily basis. seeking to turn the table  the congress has been attacking modi with counter allegations.the party has turned the heat on him by alleging scam in the government to government contract for    rafale fighter jets. it s only the latest in a string of allegations against modi  levelled by congress leaders  the others include allowing the alleged  looters  of indian banks to flee the country  bending rules to benefit certain businessmen and industrialists  and ignoring allegations against bjp president amit shah s son and other bjp ministers and leaders.hindu hridaya samrat  this is one image of modi that the congress finds hard to counter. the opposition party has  therefore  decided to work on its own image and change its impression as a muslim party. from rahul s frequent visits to temples to congress  chief spokesman randeep surjewala tweeting sanskrit shlokas on guru purnima last week  there are many indicators of how the congress is trying to play the soft hindutva card.obc prime minister  modi  an obc leader  helped the bjp  traditionally a brahmin baniya party  to widen its social base among obcs and even a section of dalits. the congress is seeking to counter it through state specific alliances with regional parties such as the sp  the bsp  the rld and the rjd  which have committed votebanks among particular obc communities and dalits.the opposition party has been attacking modi for increasing incidents of atrocities against dalits. last week  the congress echoed the outrage expressed by union minister ram vilas paswan and bjp mp udit raj over the appointment of justice  retd  a.k. goel as ngt chairman  citing his ruling as supreme court judge that diluted certain provisions of the sc st  prevention of atrocities  act. rahul has held several discussions with leaders on how to increase the congress  acceptability among the obcs   to counter modi s   but the party still does not seem to have a clue.garib maa ka beta  modi s humble background as a poor tea seller has been his usp  especially when pitted against the illustrious nehru gandhi family of the congress. it is the first thing the opposition party picked up in its bid to change the public perception about modi. starting with rahul gandhi s suit boot government jibe and projection of a proposed land acquisition bill as anti farmer  the congress has focused a great deal on modi s friendship with businessmen and industrialists  alleging undue favours to them.oratorical skill  after publicly acknowledging modi s oratorical skill  the congress has gone on to project it as  jumlabaazi   questioning the non delivery of the promised rs    lakh in everyone s bank account and constantly reminding people of the unfulfilled promises made in his speeches.jury is still out on the success or failure of the above mentioned strategy against modi  but the congress could  in the process  again turn the next elections modi centric. many congressmen argue that if sonia could come up trumps against atal bihari vajpayee in       why can t rahul in     . they need to ask themselves this.subscribe to our channels on youtube

rahul gandhi s meet with women journalists wasn t glamorous but sexist   elitist
text size  a  a as one who has spent her early days fighting to be seen as a journalist and not just a woman journalist  i see the clock turn full circle. and in not a good way.the indian women s press corps  an august body promoting segregation in a profession that can only function effectively without  is in the midst of deep conflict currently. why  because of an interaction with congress president rahul gandhi with over     some say      women journalists held at the india international centre amidst deep secrecy.the congress likes secrecy  surprised though that women journalists like it too.the controversy is on who was or was not invited. and who helped organise this selective interaction. was it the iwpc  if so  why was it not held at the organisation s office and opened for all members  why were some invited  and not the rest  on what basis was the list made or was it the congress  that to my women colleagues would be more acceptable  but then the congress too is not taking the credit. and worthies within let it be known that the initiative was not theirs but that of the iwpc. but then the president and some of the office bearers did not attend the interaction. so then the question is how could it be described as an iwpc function when the iwpc was itself not represented  and so on and so forth.the secrecy was amazing though. and not a word came out except to some women journalists  who angrily took the iwpc to task  and found their way to iic to attend the meeting. i was not invited  of course  so cannot say whether it was worth the effort. but then segregation of the congress kind   muslim intellectuals    women journalists  unfortunately has never been my cup of tea.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowvery angry are congress beat journalists and justifiably so as this interaction with rahul gandhi was denied to them. why  simple. because most of them are male scribes and hence did not qualify.as a journalist who has spent her early days in the career  like many of us  fighting to be recognised as a journalist and not a woman journalist  the clock seems to have turned full circle. and in not a good way. we fought editors who sought to push us into our little corners to cover  women  functions  we insisted we would keep the same timings as men  cover the same assignments be it conflict or crime or massacres  because we were journalists  not women dammit  the fight was intense  difficult  at times impossible but we got our way and created the space where we were respected for our work. and seen as equals  good or bad.i remember in the indian express when some new rookies were being taken in on the desk. they joined and soon after our news editor walked into the reporters  section  really looking harassed and upset.  what do i do  one of the women says she cannot stay till the newspaper is put to bed   am   another says she cannot take public transport after it gets dark   the editor said. needless to say they were asked to leave  a step supported by all of us who had ensured that our work was not compromised by such limitations.so when the iwpc came into existence i did not join it for years.  i joined in a weak moment as most of the women members are colleagues and friends and did not hesitate to lampoon me whenever we met . why do we need a separate organisation  because the press club of india is a watering hole  so why can t we contest elections there and clean it up  why do we need a separate body based on gender  when we are all journalists  and where we are all the colleagues  covering the same stories  with the same compassion and honesty and courage. how do we justify setting ourselves apart as women scribes after all when gauri lankesh is killed  all journalists have to come together. surely her assassination is not a women s issue. when shujaat bukhari is shot down  it is surely not just a male scribe issue. why should women journalists claim exclusivity  and a separateness that goes against the very grain of journalism this morning i heard jaya bhaduri ask why male members in the house were not speaking about the increasing  horrific  attacks on women  is rape now just a women s issue  journalists are expected to report  women issues  with the same skills  be they women or men. i simply cannot accept the reasoning that  women are more sensitive  for if the men are not equally so they need to find another profession. and in the years in this profession  i have witnessed colleagues  men and women  do an equally good job when it comes to reporting such issues.also if this argument is taken to its logical conclusion  then men by virtue of access will be better political reporters than women. or alone can cover conflict. balderdash this segregation  of course  suits the political parties that can then further divide the profession that is already under deep attack. rahul gandhi meeting women journalists probably has a glamourous ring to it  but there would have been a time when any effort to so segregate would have been resisted by scribes themselves. it is a tragedy that we are wilfully allowing this to happen  and instead of being part of the larger fraternity are becoming an exclusive club  and dare i say an elitist body as compared to the press club of india that is egalitarian in its approach .this article was originally published

covid    unlocked rahul gandhi s new avatar   retired european social democrat
text size  a  a if it wasn t for the novel coronavirus and the nationwide lockdown  congress leader rahul gandhi would not have discovered his true political character   a retired european social democrat.over the past two months  covid    related social restrictions have afforded rahul gandhi a chance to do the kind of politics that he has always wanted to. he can interview economists and scientists from harvard and oxford over zoom calls. he can address virtual press conferences  and if something goes wrong  he can use social media to berate the news media for misconstruing his statements.in fact  it was the bjp s arch political strategist and home minister amit shah who  during a virtual rally  called out gandhi s new avatar. people are discussing in english about india s fight against coronavirus in sweden and america. please give an account of what you have done except giving interviews   said shah during his address to odisha s bjp cadre and supporters.by talking about  sweden  america  and interviews   amit shah is dissing rahul gandhi for interviewing academics from sweden and america  while he further implied that those countries are busy discussing how prime minister narendra modi  fixed  the pandemic situation in india.it seems that amit shah really gets rahul gandhi   someone who broadly adheres to european notions of social democracy  is more enthused with academic debates than talking to india s rag tag masses  prefers working from home like a politician who has quit active politics  and uses twitter to critique the government.in a way  rahul gandhi appears to be doing what european social democrats do after quitting active politics.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowalso read  india  us aren t as tolerant as they used to be  rahul gandhi to ex diplomat nicholas burnswho is a european social democrat there are two aspects to them. first  they act like retired politicians. second  their worldview is situated in broad euro centric conception of social democracy  which accepts markets but only if supplemented with a lot of welfare. rahul gandhi meets both these criteria.over the past few months  rahul gandhi s politics have been eerily similar to the post retirement politics of tony blair  the former british prime minister and leader of the labour party. both hate the people in power and want to fundamentally overhaul the direction of their countries. but they feel they can do so by intellectually changing public sentiment  as opposed to indulging themselves in hardcore politics. gandhi has especially tried to do this after stepping down from congress  presidentship.blair is remembered for effectively moving his party towards the centre  and rebranding it as the  new left . but since his retirement in       he has tried to influence labour politics and the general direction of the uk in one way or the other. most notable was his attempt to reverse the uk s      brexit referendum vote  and somehow ensure that his country stayed within the european union.blair hoped his intellectual and passionate defence of the uk s rightful place in the eu would sway public mood. never mind the fact that during the same time  boris johnson and his cabal were busy dethroning theresa may so they could come to power and oust the uk from the eu.miliband style politicsthis brings us to another british labour party leader edward miliband. after stepping down from active politics  miliband has kept alive the post retirement social democratic tradition  trying to influence politics by becoming a popular podcaster and radio host. but just before he quit politics  miliband oversaw probably the most significant decision in labour party s recent history.under miliband  the labour party s membership fee was drastically reduced and brought down to just a few pounds. this facilitated the entry of thousands of hard left millennials into the labour party. that helped its next leader jeremy corbyn expand his base and turn tony blair s centrist labour party into a somewhat socialist one.affinity to left leaning economistsit is in terms of the worldview that rahul gandhi is increasingly beginning to echo the views of european social democrats. nothing reflects this better than the economists he chose to virtually interview during the covid crisis. both abhijit banerjee and raghuram rajan  though highly respected economists across the world  belong squarely to the left side of the economic spectrum.while they both have sufficient experience with india  their policy suggestions are often critiqued as

who really influenced rajiv gandhi to act against shah bano judgment 
text size  a  a both the hindu right and liberals blame rajiv gandhi for the shah bano flip flop  accusing him of indulging in minority appeasement.contrary to popular belief  it was not rajiv gandhi who fielded his minister ziaur rahman ansari to challenge the supreme court judgment in the         shah bano case. for too long  rajiv has been pilloried by indians over his role in surrendering to muslim conservatives during the shah bano episode.but a new book by ansari s son says it was the other way around.in an upcoming book titled wings of destiny  ziaur rahman ansari   a life   highbrow scribes publications          ansari s canada based son fasihur rahman claims that it was actually his father  driven by religious zeal and armed with a resignation letter  who had prevailed upon rajiv to overturn the apex court s verdict.ansari informed rajiv that he will challenge the apex court s verdict in mohammad ahmad khan vs shah bano begum  delivered by the five judge constitution bench comprising chief justice y.v. chandrachud  justices ranganath misra  d.a. desai  o. chinnappa reddy and e.s. venkataramiah on    april     .fasihur  a trained environmental scientist and a fellow at the university of british columbia  okanagan campus  canada  writes in the book that there has been a  preconceived notion  dominant till date that it was rajiv or the congress party who had emboldened ansari to speak against the judgment.both the hindu right and liberals blame rajiv for the shah bano flip flop  accusing him of indulging in minority appeasement and giving in to orthodox muslim clergy that was represented by ansari and the all india muslim personal law board  aimplb . this stand on shah bano overshadowed his other achievements such as ushering the computer age in india  and the science and technology missions.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowafter a year of debate  rajiv gandhi government brought the muslim women  protection of rights on divorce  act       to overturn the judgment of the supreme court following pressure from muslims  including ulamas  who said that the judgment was in conflict with sharia.in the book  fasihur quotes the telegraph  calcutta from back then   the congress  i  had decided to field another minister  mr. z.r. ansari  to contradict his  arif mohammad khan assertion on the floor of the house.  he also cites the times of india editorial stating   it is clear beyond doubt that mr. gandhi gave mr. ansari the go ahead signal. in plain terms  mr. ansari too was not acting at his own initiative. according to fasihur  his father was even prepared to resign from the union council of ministers if rajiv had not let him speak in parliament against the supreme court verdict. i wish to set the record straight   fasihur writes.  there is no iota of truth in such preconceived notions that ziaur rahman ansari  s intervention in the debate related to the supreme court judgment in shah bano case was at the behest of rajiv gandhi or the congress party. his intervention in the debate was his personal decision impelled by his conscience. it was neither the congress party nor rajiv gandhi who asked him to speak as has been claimed in various articles. aziz qureshi  who later became the governor of uttarakhand during the upa years  was also present at this ansari gandhi meeting.quoting qureshi  the author writes   magnanimous rajiv gandhi took the resignation letter  tore it and threw it in a dustbin. who is stopping you to speak  rajiv gandhi asked ziaur rahman. how many well wishers do we have remained  sic  with us now  gandhi added  according to dr. aziz qureshi. fasihur s account is a little different from the one that was put forth two years ago by senior bureaucrat wajahat habibullah. according to that version  it was m.j. akbar who had influenced rajiv to support the stance taken by the muslim clergy. then  one day as i entered prime minister rajiv gandhi s chamber  i found m.j. akbar sitting across his table. rajiv smiled cheerily   come in  come in wajahat  you are one of us.  habibullah had recalled that he found rajiv s greeting  odd  but discovered the reason soon enough.  mr. akbar had convinced rajiv that if the government were not to contest the shah bano judgment  it would appear to the muslim community that the prime minister did not regard them as his own. in what he perceived as the defence of their religious rights  rajiv would show himself worthy of the support that the community had always placed in his family. this was the argument that mr. akbar developed in a doordarshan debate with then minister arif mohammed khan  in which mr. khan had argued that the koranic provision or lack of it for maintenance was neither a compulsion nor closed to interpretation. but mr. akbar  more westernised  had argued that the muslims needed the reassurance that only an amendment could bring. akbar  currently a minister in narendra modi government  did not contest habibullah s claim.rasheed kidwai is an orf visiting fellow  author and journalist. the views expressed here are his own.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis   only

can rahul gandhi put     dead cats on the table 
text size  a  a      is nigh and it will be raining dead cats from the modi campaign.presuming that the      lok sabha elections will be held on the same dates as       the last day of campaigning will be    may     . that s     days away.to make any significant impact this election  rahul gandhi needs to put     dead cats on the table.when you put a dead cat on the table  no one can ignore it. everyone will talk about it. in the process  you have succeeded in making sure people don t talk about what they planned to.also known as deadcatting  it is a strategy in business and politics  used most famously by australian political strategist lynton crosby. in the words of british politician boris johnson  one of crosby s clients   there is one thing that is absolutely certain about throwing a dead cat on the dining room table   and i don t mean that people will be outraged  alarmed  disgusted. that is true  but irrelevant. the key point  says my australian friend  is that everyone will shout   jeez  mate  there s a dead cat on the table   rahul s hug  even his wink  was a dead cat on the table. without the hug  the headline would have been  modi wins trust vote . people would have been talking about how poor the opposition numbers looked  how opposition unity is still a chimera  and how modi gave another bombastic speech on the historical wrongs of the congress party.rahul s hug and wink changed the conversation. all opposition politicians who complain that a biased media doesn t give them space should note that even the most pro modi media outlets could not ignore the rahul hug. they may have trashed it but they could not ignore it.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowany publicity is good publicitythe hindi proverb  badnaam hi huay tou kya  naam tou hua  comes to mind. politicians like narendra modi and donald trump win even when they lose because they always occupy your mind space. whether modi does right or wrong  whether he fails or succeeds  whether he goes to uganda or uttarakhand  whether he s in parliament or inside the namo app  he s always occupying your attention.as the      election approaches  there will scarcely be a space where you won t find a modi poster. in the post modi era  elections are about occupying mind space more than delivering any development. this is what partly explains the power of brand modi to win elections for the bjp despite its failures. the bjp should not have won uttar pradesh after the failure of demonetisation was clear  it should not have won gujarat after the troubles caused by the hasty implementation of gst  and it should not have emerged as the single largest party in karnataka with a discredited yeddyurappa as the local face.but modi makes sure you always think of modi more than you think about gst  demonetisation or the bjp s uninspiring local leaders.the salman khan eid releasewhat was that fitness challenge about  everybody s asking what happened to  acche din   and modi is asking celebrities to post fitness videos on twitter. how does that make any sense modi posts his own exercise video for which he gets ridiculed endlessly on social media. a million memes make fun of the prime minister s fitness regime. yet these memes only help modi because they make sure you think only modi  modi  modi.just think of all the terrible bollywood movies we watch just because the producers carpet bombed us with pre release publicity. not watching the film would then make us feel like we missed something. it is the success of the bollywood publicity machine that people often say they went to see the film with low expectations. if you didn t expect it to be worthy of your time why did you go for it modi  then  is the political equivalent of the salman khan eid release.attention over meritin his book the attention merchants  the epic struggle to get inside our heads  tim wu writes how we live in an attention economy. such is the scramble among attention merchants to get inside our heads that grabbing attention alone can make people win. the last chapter in wu s book is on trump. he writes   history shows that dominating mindshare is a classic strategy of influence  because the sheer volume of messaging allows the leader to drown out alternatives  transform minds and begin changing the rules of the game itself. wu draws a distinction between  attentional contests  and the  contests based in merit . in the case of trump  as in the case of modi  you can t win just because you are right  or better. you have to win the attentional contest. merit doesn t matter.that is why one hug and wink can t do it. over the next nine months  modi will put one dead cat on the table after another. he will make us talk about what he wants us to talk about. he will make sure that his supporters  his critics and the fence sitters talk about modi  modi and only modi.one hug and one wink won t do it for rahul. he needs his own     dead cats on the table.subscribe to our channels on

modi isn t the only master of surprises. rahul has learnt to use the weapon too
text size  a  a rahul gandhi s hug can be criticised  ridiculed or rubbished  but its visual is going to last till the      election results.prime minister narendra modi is a past master in frequently deploying the political weapon of  surprise  in his      politics. now  the president of the congress party rahul gandhi is playing catch up.surprise  rather shock and awe  have been powerful political weapons. their impact is not measurable  but they have often changed the nature of relationships  within the country or even internationally.internationally  nikita khrushchev s visit to the un and banging the podium with his shoe in       mao zedong s launch of cultural revolution in       the tet offensive by vietnam s  vietcongs  in       henry kissinger s secret visit to china in       and mikhail gorbachev s dramatic announcement of glasnost and perestroika  policies of openness and restructuring the economy  have changed the course of world history.george w. bush s famous  shock and awe  attack on iraq to current us president donald trump s still inexplicable summits with north korea s autocrat kim jong un and russian president vlamidir putin are also some recent examples.within the country  modi is known to be in constant search of something dramatic. some of his advisers say that he often asks for something  big  that can be announced   from a national  run for unity  on vallabhbhai patel s birth anniversary to international yoga day the hug and its appealwhether rahul gandhi s scintillating somersault from the opposition to the treasury benches and his sudden hug to narendra modi was a preplanned move or impromptu is not the point. the act can be criticised  ridiculed or rubbished  but its visual is going to last  at least  till the      election results  if not longer.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowalthough the prime minister tried to run down that stunned moment by his usual demagogic speech  the day would still be remembered for that embrace  which changed the contours of the election campaign. imagine  david  instead of slinging a stone at goliath  suddenly walks up to him and hugs him  thereby  disarming him completely. that day  rahul was a gandhian david.this image is going to haunt modi throughout the next    months. whether he and his campaigners describe rahul s action as childish  unbecoming of the party president  or unparliamentary  it has stuck. this is because the action came at the end of his appeal   you have a lot of hate towards me  you have a lot of anger towards me  to you i am a pappu  you can call me all sorts of names  but i have not an iota of anger  an iota of hatred towards you  i am congress  i have learnt that no matter how much you are abused and attacked  your heart must remain full of love .it is not possible to counter this appeal. the more rahul is attacked  the more he will bounce back. it is a repeat of history. indira gandhi was routinely ridiculed as  goongi gudiya  by ram manohar lohia  but when she counterattacked by sacking morarji desai as finance minister and nationalised the major banks  she stunned her critics. it was not a  love  weapon  but surely a  surprise  missile.a favourite weaponmodi has used the  surprise  weapon frequently  demonetisation being the best example. it still haunts him and his detractors. his first surprise move was the dismissal of the planning commission from the ramparts of the red fort. in the last four years  he has used this weapon so often that his bhakts now warn his critics and say  just wait for a surprise .few of the  surprises  seem to have been neutralised in advance. for instance  some people thought that he would wage a war with pakistan to generate nationalist euphoria. some others thought  and still think  that he would bring nirav modi or vijay mallya back to india and make them face trial just a few weeks before the elections. there are others who still anticipate that he will  eliminate  dawood ibrahim and will display his brave fight against terrorism.there was also speculation that he will deposit rs    lakh in citizens  bank accounts. indeed  there are so many reforms waiting to be undertaken  some of them dramatic  that they will provide modi with the  surprise  missile. he has created a huge social media network  armed with hyperactive trolls  who will promote those  surprise  policy surgical strikes.david versus goliathalthough it is early to speculate on the outcome of the      elections  it is surely not going to be a boring confrontation between a nondescript pappu and a giant modi. modi s aggressive politics  and amit shah s machiavellian strategies have created an atmosphere of fear even within the bjp  to which rahul referred and said that only love will defeat the politics based on hate and fear .the mahagatbandhan has many davids   from chandrababu naidu to akhilesh yadav  arvind kejriwal to kamal haasan  and mamata banerjee to mayawati. all the non congress opposition parties were apprehensive of rahul and the congress. but with rahul displaying the  surprise  element  the equation has changed  at least for now.modi  however  has several opportunities to display his  surprise  weapon again   independence day could offer him that chance. modi has perfected the art of keeping the opposition guessing and worried  and he is not someone who will give up. the only thing that has changed is that the opposition too has learnt to use the weapon of  surprise  now.kumar ketkar is a former editor and congress member of rajya sabha.subscribe

modi can t hope to fight love guru rahul with the chaiwalla narrative
text size  a  a if the opposition party makes anti moditva its central plank  a smart counter strategy would be a constant evolution of moditva.how do you respond when congress chief rahul gandhi proclaims himself a love guru in parliament and croons bryan adams  song from the opposition bench   look into my eyes  you will see what you mean to me   if you are prime minister narendra modi  you will need to change your narrative. never was it as apparent as on friday when a mere hug seemed to have a smothering effect on his usual rhapsody about his humble origin and the unprecedented transformation of the country under his leadership.you may give sardonic smiles and be didactic about an opposition leader eyeing your chair. but you can t be so predictable   a poor mother s son from a backward caste and a kaamdaar ranged against a naamdaar. the narrative fitted well when a  chaiwalla  was aspiring to become the prime minister of the country. it may sound hypocritical and evasive if a prime minister talks like this when accused of crony capitalism by the president of the principal opposition party.there is a method in rahul s repeated suit boot barbs at modi or insinuations of corruption in defence deals. the congress party seems to have concluded that since the bjp s narrative revolves around modi  its own narrative has to be built around anti moditva.so  it is raising questions about everything moditva is supposed to represent. if it is about a strong leader  project him as a dictator who is bent on throttling all opposition voices and sending them to jail  an arrogant leader who finds everyone else a  pappu   and an unreliable leader who has reduced his solemn promises to people to mere  jumlas . another prong of the congress party s strategy is if moditva thrives on the fine blend of development and hindutva  expose the fault lines and inherent contradictions and show how the two can t go together.if it is about probity and transparency  raise doubts about it by hurling allegations of corruption  however unsubstantiated and baseless they may be. the grand old party had been at the receiving end of such campaigns for decades and now it seems to have decided to adopt the same strategy to target its adversaries.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs

account number and win  if a narendra modi could paint the entire congress as corrupt  promise to deposit rs    lakh of recovered black money in everyone s bank accounts and win  why can t rahul gandhi try out the same  what narrative did the congress have in       anyway if the opposition party makes anti moditva its central plank  a smart counter strategy would be a constant evolution of moditva. it can t remain stuck with its anti congressism narrative.for instance  every time a congress leader speaks about surgical strikes  doklam standoff or security scenario in kashmir  modi and other bjp leaders jump to question his or her patriotism. the anti national allegation has become too repetitive to make the nation feel outraged over and over again.modi and his colleagues are given to enumerating long lists of achievements  not leaving any numerals or decimals. hapless people often get a sense of deja vu. remember those growth figures in manmohan singh s and p. chidambaram s speeches  remember how then upa chairperson sonia gandhi s repeated references to central funds  read largesse  to states used to sound feudal in those days these numbers are important for a country but how much they translate into votes is a matter of debate. blame it on the growing sense of entitlement all around   thanks also to those freebies and waivers that are now part of every government s welfare agenda   that the more a ruling party offers  the more are the expectations. and  it s more so in modi s case.a ruling party has to talk about its achievements  but it can t be a boisterous       seven days a week and     days a year celebration. it may be jarring to even modi voters who are still waiting for their turn to get the benefits. and there may be millions of such voters even though there may be million others whose lives have been touched by the nda government s schemes and programmes. it was okay to promise the moon to the people before the elections  but you can t promise them the sun to keep them hooked on to you post elections.that s why modi needs to change the narrative. and  he knows it better than any commentariat. but carrying the entire burden of the party and the government alone may be taking a toll.his minders also seem to be growing tired. why else would they not alert him about rahul s not so veiled threat to him and bjp president amit shah on the floor of the lok sabha  the amethi mp said modi and shah are scared of losing power because if they do   other processes  will start against them. rahul who is under investigation in national herald case left nothing to imagination.there was no response from modi or any other bjp mp. in old days  modi would have made hay of his threat and his wink post the hug. on friday  the master orator

rahul gandhi had another chance to look different from modi. comeback shows same old problems
text size  a  a rahul gandhi is trying to reinvent himself. yet again. and he is making the same mistakes. yet again. the big problem with the congress leader s nth  comeback  is that he refuses to leave his big problems behind.rahul gandhi s slew of  interviews    with economists raghuram rajan and abhijit banerjee as well as industrialist rajiv bajaj   underscore everything that is wrong with him. his entitlement  amazing ability to live in his own comfortable bubble instead of connecting with the masses  and desire to listen and talk to only those who agree with him have been among his biggest failings. unfortunately  rahul n.  is coming across as no different.rahul gandhi attempting to make a comeback itself is amusing  considering he stepped down as congress president  despite several in his party pleading him not to  and sulked for a long time after that. essentially  his exits and entries are entirely based on his whims and fancies  a message that gets reinforced repeatedly.this latest remodelling shows he is obviously gearing up to sit on the throne again  and for that  he has decided to make his mark by taking on the bharatiya janata party  bjp  government.however  while rahul gandhi s intent isn t wrong  his method is. his idea of trying to corner the narendra modi led government on uncomfortable issues such as the slowing economy and the jobless workers  crisis is the obvious political move any serious opposition would and should make  but his manner of doing it is silly and ill advised.also read  lockdown flattened the wrong curve   gdp instead of covid  rajiv bajaj tells rahul gandhiproblematic image  flawed methodwhat rahul gandhi has always suffered from is the burden of his image   of being an entitled dynast  disconnected from ground reality  unable to understand realpolitik  lack of consistency  and refusing to get out of his cocoon. not many voters have taken him seriously as a politician. i have travelled across several parts of india to cover elections  and found many echoing that sentiment.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowmodi s soaring popularity didn t help gandhi s cause even as he has pitted himself directly against the bjp s trump card.what rahul gandhi needs  if at all he insists on continuing in politics and leading the congress  is a complete facelift. unfortunately  it doesn t seem like things are headed that way.consider this. rahul gandhi is engaging with all like minded people   his ilk of elite and uncomfortable with modi personalities. raghuram rajan resigned as rbi governor in      and has since been criticising the modi government. nobel laureate abhijit banerjee s left leaning approach to economy suits rahul gandhi and he played a crucial role in conceptualising congress  nyay scheme ahead of the      lok sabha election. rajiv bajaj and rahul s families go back a long way and the bonhomie they shared during their interaction was clearly visible.the congress scion also held an interaction with public healthcare experts dr ashish jha and johan giesecke.in all these interactions  rahul gandhi is operating well within his comfort zone  and not really doing anything to reach out to the masses. twitter hashtags such as  rahulshowstheway weren t very effective either.these attempts are nearly as bad as bjp spokespersons interviewing bjp ministers. and modi gets away with a lot of ludicrous stuff simply because of his popularity and a well oiled social media machine working round the clock to keep his  development man  image intact. rahul gandhi doesn t have that advantage.therefore  what the congress leader needs to do is connect with his voters  hold virtual rallies  and find a coherent theme to corner the modi government. gandhi must also allow dissenting intellectuals and journalists to interview him  and hold free wheeling media interactions  digitally . moreover  instead of making it all about his grandstanding  he should focus more on selling the congress  the good work done by his party s chief ministers in handling the coronavirus crisis and letting them take the centre stage.it s hardly an argument that prime minister modi is the most undemocratic leader and refuses to take questions from the media or get rid of his monologues. but this is all the more reason for rahul gandhi to stand out and make an effort to distinguish himself from modi.also read  bjp questions  bjp answers   party s new social media experiment as modi govt completes a yearwhy rahul gandhi at some point  the congress must explain why rahul gandhi is investing so much in making a comeback  and if he is  why he is not officially heading the party at an unprecedented time like this.rahul gandhi gave up the post of congress president a long time ago. right now  he is just another parliamentarian. this raises a question  why is  just another  congress mp taking on the mantle and trying to emerge as the torchbearer of his party during a pandemic  when so many of congress  chief ministers are actually fighting the crisis in their respective states this again points to the same problem   entitlement. rahul gandhi  by virtue of being rahul gandhi  will act as per his fancy  choosing to walk out when he is upset and deciding to waltz back in when he wishes to.not that him leading the congress is anything short of a disaster  but the right thing to do when you want to hog all the limelight is to first at least take on the responsibility and accountability of a crucial position.the congress leader needs to think hard  entirely re imagine his approach to politics  and stop being so self indulgent  if at all he wants to remain a politician. because this way  he harms the congress by repeatedly reminding the voter how ineffective its leader

why is congress helping bjp make      a hindu muslim election 
text size  a  a rahul gandhi  shashi tharoor  mallikarjun kharge  sam pitroda   they are all trying to help the bjp with communal polarisation.even the most rabid religious fundamentalist has multiple identities. a person may be a religious hindu and a political hindutva nationalist  and at the same time have other identities such as caste  class and profession.a rashtriya swayamsewak sangh  rss  volunteer in uttar pradesh could also be a brahmin upset with the domination of thakurs under the yogi adityanath regime. he could also be a large farmer upset with the modi government s indifference towards declining incomes of agriculturists  never mind the recent increase in minimum support prices.it is obvious that the bhartiya janata party  bjp  will remind such a voter before elections of his hindu identity. it will tell him that the other options he has are all pro muslim and anti hindu. it will try to make the emotional hindu muslim divide the main agenda through which he will perceive this election. in the process  it will make him forget other identities  such as that of his caste and profession.starting from rajiv gandhi s era in the late    s  the congress has been falling into the bjp s hindutva trap. the congress bungled up on issues both hindu and muslim. in a country with a hindu majority and a first past the post electoral system  the bjp was bound to benefit.any serious challenge to the bjp came from the non congress socialist parties. it was people like v.p. singh  lalu yadav and mulayam singh yadav who realised that caste identity could counter the bjp s appeal to religious identity. as recently as the bihar assembly election in       the bjp tried to polarise voters along hindu muslim lines using the issue of beef. but the nitish lalu alliance worked on another polarisation  backward versus forward castes  to change the social agenda of the election.repeating historywe are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowhaving made this mistake over and over again  the congress party refuses to learn from it. having seen the socialist parties repeatedly benefit from the strategy of changing the agenda  the congress refuses to learn from it. the congress party refuses to learn.yes  going to temples and asserting that they are hindu not hindutva is a good idea. given the bjp has labelled the congress as an anti hindu party  it is useful for the congress to assert that its hindu members are indeed hindu. rahul gandhi s temple visits are helpful because if nothing else  they counter the pro muslim image created by political iftars.but if the congress was to make religious identity a major part of its pitch  it can only lose because that is the bjp s agenda. you can t win elections by helping the bjp in its agenda. a debate over good hindu and bad hindu  good muslim and bad muslim  secularism and communalism is precisely what the bjp wants.facing double anti incumbency in most of india  what could be better for the bjp than to shift the national political agenda from questioning its governance to questioning its religious agenda  party of muslims on    july  in a meeting with a group of intellectuals from the muslim community  rahul gandhi is said to have assured them that muslims will feel safe again once the congress comes to power.the key word here is power. how will the congress come to power  by changing the narrative from religion to other things such as caste  governance  unemployment  and violence against dalits. only through these the congress can come to power and give better security to muslims.many muslims themselves understand this better than the congress. historian s.i. habib  not to be confused with irfan habib of aligarh  is reported to have said at the same meeting that the congress should raise issues that matter to everyone and not just muslims. it is only the khan market liberals who get upset about this line of argument.knowing very well that such an event could be exploited by the bjp  rahul could have organised a meeting of intellectuals from all religious minorities. whether or not rahul said that the congress was a party of muslims is disputed by people who attended the meeting.perhaps  this was an unintended mistake caused by rahul s typical poor planning and absent mindedness. but how does one explain shashi tharoor  even after his party cautioned him to be careful about the use of words in taking on the bjp  tharoor is going on and on about  hindu pakistan . it is as if tharoor wants to be the new mani shankar aiyar  and lo and behold  the fellow stephanian has written an article supporting tharoor.temple versus jobsnot to be left behind  rajiv gandhi s friend sam pitroda has made a similar self goal. speaking in gandhinagar  the head of the overseas chapter of the congress said that temples weren t going to create jobs. factually correct  of course  but what is the message to religious hindus  the message is that pitroda and his party deride temple going  even as rahul does so himself before every election. when i hear all the debates in this country about temple  religion  god  caste  i worry about india. temples are not going to create jobs for tomorrow. only science will create the future   pitroda said.why does there have to be a contradiction between paying obeisance before a deity and having a job  more importantly  why can t pitroda talk about jobs without referring to temples  does he not remember the political damage the ram mandir movement caused his friend rajiv development versus secularismthe party s veteran leader from karnataka  mallikarjun kharge  has done his own bit to shift the political debate from development to religious identity.the congress supported chief minister h.d. kumaraswamy  playing his own power games  said he was unable to deliver on governance because his party didn t get the full mandate. in other words  he was blaming his ally  the congress  for not being able to deliver.what was the congress  reply secularism  said kharge. don t forget secularism. what is the message to religious hindu voters  that their development needs are somehow in conflict with the safety and security of muslims don t forget secularism  but what is the message to religious hindu voters  it is not possible that these veteran leaders can t see what they are doing. the question is  why are they doing it but why are they doing this the charitable answer is that they have nothing else to offer. they are unable to woo new castes  offer any national mass leader  unable to show any good governance in punjab or karnataka or anywhere. so  all they are left with is the hindu muslim divide.the uncharitable explanation is that the congress has a hindutva death wish. it actually wants the bjp to win and make india a hindu pakistan.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis   only you can fix it you are reading this because you value good  intelligent and objective

not congress but bjp has lived up to the commitment to preserve constitution
text size  a  a critics of deendayal upadhyaya must remember the bjp ideologue never advocated wholesale amendment or mutilation of the constitution.in the last few days  much has been written about how the bharatiya janata party  bjp   if voted back to power in       will make india a  hindu pakistan .along with the bjp  the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh  rss  too was dragged into the controversy with some experts quoting the rss ideologues  criticism and reservations regarding the constitution.historical evidence  however  will rather point fingers at the congress party for trying to undermine the authority of the constitution. let us examine a few instances of the same the first assault on the spirit of the constitution of india was inflicted by none other than prime minister jawaharlal nehru in      whereby inter alia  the state was given a carte blanche to make any law to curtail the hitherto untrammeled right to freedom of speech and expression on the grounds of interests of  security of state  friendly relations with foreign countries  public order  decency or morality  in relation to contempt of court  defamation of incitement to an offence . so much for the nehruvian commitment to liberal values the assault on india s constitutional values became so pernicious in the subsequent years that a    judge bench of the supreme court was forced to draw up what is known as the basic structure doctrine  which entailed that certain provisions of the constitution could not be amended. it was this doctrine which came to the rescue of india s people when the   th amendment act of       which basically rendered the office of pm immune from the judicial process  was struck down by the apex court.then came the   nd amendment act of       which was piloted by indira gandhi s emergency regime.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowinter alia  the said amendment barred the jurisdiction of the supreme court when it came to adjudging the validity of constitutional amendments  placed laws meant to curb  anti national  activities beyond the purview of judicial scrutiny  extended the tenure of lok sabha and state assemblies from five to six years  empowered the centre to employ its armed forces to meet any exigency in relation to law and order  and extended the one time duration of employment of president s rule in a state from five to six years.this amendment was an attack on federalism  democracy  separation of powers and freedom of speech and expression. thankfully  some of its damaging aspects were watered down by the   thamendment act of       brought in during the tenure of the janata party government.the last full majority congress government was in power from          and its record of protecting and preserving the spirit of the constitution was not stellar either. in       it brought in a bill whereby inter alia the onus of proving the truth of a statement in relation to a political figure was placed on the person making such a statement. this was at variance with the common law jurisprudence and the said bill was withdrawn in the face of massive protests.those who are critical of deendayal upadhyaya and his views on placing the indian nationhood over and above the social contract under the constitution must remember that the veteran bjp ideologue never advocated wholesale amendment or mutilation of the constitution.even m.s. golwalkar s criticism of the constitution can be attributed to the charged atmosphere in the country during partition. as a matter of fact  even home minister sardar vallabhbhai patel was recorded by historian sarvepalli gopal as having said that muslims in india should be held as  hostages  to ensure that hindus in pakistan were treated with respect and dignity.finally  the debate around the bjp s commitment to the constitution was settled when no less than prime minister narendra modi said that the constitution was the only  holy book  for him.the bjp government s record over the past four years speaks for itself. only three amendments to the constitution have been moved from      to     .the first one was in relation to the national judicial appointments commission  which was struck down by the supreme court as being violative of the basic structure doctrine and has not been revived since then . the second one was in relation to the india bangladesh land boundary agreement while the third amendment was brought in to usher the goods and services tax regime in the country.the choice between the people of india in      can therefore be reduced to a binary. they can either vote for the bjp   a party that has lived up to its commitment to preserve the constitution in spite of a few comments here and there by known motormouths. or  they could vote for the congress  a party that has a long and disgraceful record of trying to subvert india s constitutional structure.raghav awasthi is an advocate and an rss member.also read  a  hindu pakistan  wouldn t be hindu at all  but

by lecturing tharoor on  hindu pakistan   congress again reveals its ideological confusion
text size  a  a one may or may not agree with tharoor s conclusions  but he certainly didn t deserve lectures from the shergills and surjewalas of his party.there is a signature line that congress president rahul gandhi uses in private conversation   the congress is not an organisation  it is an ideology. a recent addition to this is   modi is jittery. you see it on his face. he elaborated it to a visitor a few days back    the bjp will not win even    of the      lok sabha  seats in up and bihar. most people come out of these meetings with rahul gandhi stirred  if not shaken   not by his assessment  but by his sheer confidence and sincerity of conviction. the party s stands and its actions on issues tell a different story though. it has been found cowering every time the bjp drags it into a hindu muslim debate.since getting drubbed in the      general elections  the congress seems to be desperately seeking to change its projected image of a minority appeaser. this explains why gandhi starts visiting temples during elections  takes a short break for a foreign jaunt  and then holds an in camera meeting with the muslim intelligentsia after the polls.how else could one explain the party s haste to disown shashi tharoor s remark that if the bjp wins the      elections  india will become a hindu pakistan we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowno time to understandit s understandable why bjp spokespersons such as g.v.l. narasimha rao and sambit patra rushed to the tv studios to declare the congress  anti hindu . one may or may not agree with tharoor s conclusions  but he certainly didn t deserve lectures from the shergills and surjewalas of his party on  india s values and fundamentals .they had no time to consult him or even read his entire construct   pakistan was created as a state with a dominant religion that discriminates against its minorities and denies them equal rights . the bjp rss idea of a hindu rashtra is the mirror image of pakistan   a state with a dominant majority religion that seeks to put its minorities in a subordinate place. that would be a hindu pakistan  and it is not what our freedom movement fought for  nor the idea of india enshrined in our constitution. does the congress differ  of course not. in fact  the congress president described tharoor as a  role model  at a meeting of professionals in new delhi saturday. but gandhi wouldn t say it outside  or on his twitter handle.in fact  most congressmen also agreed with and privately applauded kapil sibal for his stand in the supreme court that hearings on the ayodhya dispute be deferred until after      elections. but  officially  the party refused to endorse his line.the aiyar parallelthe congress believes that sibal s and tharoor s lines of argument could be used by the bjp to polarise hindu votes  just as the  neech kism ka aadmi  jibe at modi by fellow st stephen s college alumnus mani shankar aiyar cost the congress dearly in the last gujarat assembly elections. the party suspended aiyar based on media reports  but hasn t sought any explanation from him.as he didn t hear from the party s disciplinary committee to which his case we referred seven months back  aiyar himself took the initiative to seek meetings with panel members. he has met a.k. antony thrice  motilal vora twice   the second time after having been made to wait for over an hour in an adjacent room   and sushil kumar shinde once. they wouldn t commit to anything  for the high command is wary of the possible media outrage if his suspension is revoked. neither sonia nor rahul gandhi has spoken to him once after his controversial remark.rahul s father rajiv gandhi was junior to aiyar at doon school and at cambridge. their first meeting at doon was when rajiv came to seek his permission to use the swimming pool. he got it instantly. decades hence  no congressman is ready to offer a hand to the drowning aiyar.it s not because the congress believes that tharoor and aiyar  the two stephanians with a penchant for controversy  really damaged the party and so should be punished. sonia gandhi s  maut ka saudagar  jibe at narendra modi in the      gujarat assembly elections might have hurt the party more. rahul gandhi s own public denouncement of manmohan singh government s ordinance on convicted lawmakers might have caused irreparable damage to the congress and the upa government s image.ideological confusionthe cases of tharoor and aiyar only bring to light the utter confusion in the congress about where it stands ideologically. nobody betrays this confusion more than the congress president himself.one day  he projects himself as a devotee of shiva  who declares his intent to go on a kailash mansarovar yatra after a flight scare. another day  he cancels this plan and focusses on hosting an iftar party and reaching out to the muslim intelligentsia.these moves give an impression that the congress leader is trying to appease the hindus one day and the muslims the next. if gandhi has to dispel this impression  he should be quick to respond to modi s jibe and spell out his stance on the triple talaq bill and nikah halala. vacillations on these issues would render the congress unpopular on both sides of the divide.as it is  if people vote for the congress  not as an organisation but as an ideology  in       they will be terribly confused.also read

game changing green revolution may have led to congress party s decline in india
text size  a  a green revolution was comparable in magnitude to the impact of the industrial revolution on manufacturing and led to the rise of agrarian opposition parties in india.there is a consensus among economic historians that technological changes act as important determinants of economic growth  but  sometimes  they can also disrupt political power. the green revolution had a curious political impact on the congress  single party dominance in india.the green revolution introduced high yielding variety  hyv  crops and strengthened the economic incentives and capacity of the politically excluded group of agricultural producers to seek greater political representation and facilitated collective action. the hyv crops and technology played a pivotal role in the rise of agrarian opposition parties.in terms of its impact on agriculture  the green revolution was comparable in magnitude to the impact of the industrial revolution on manufacturing.in the context of rural exclusion from the urban and elite dominated leadership of the congress party  the green revolution contributed to the rise of agrarian opposition parties. this resulted in india s historical transition from single party dominance to multiparty competition  and democratic deepening. it was a quintessential case of  political creative destruction .an analysis of the district level panel data on the share of agricultural land planted with hyv crops over time  geocoded to over        election races between      and      show the key political role green revolution played.these dynamics also have important implications for the political economy of development. they support the idea that entrenched political elites possess strategic incentives to block or carefully manage technological change.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowon the other hand  the electoral effects of positive rainfall increased rural wealth but did not change rural incentives to seek political power or capacity for collective action. this suggests that a pure wealth effect would not have contributed to political turnover to the same extent.green revolution increased the wealth of a politically excluded group and increased its ability to finance political mobilisation at the expense of incumbents. this corresponds to the argument that rising economic groups  newfound wealth improves their ability to successfully change the regime.new technologies can facilitate collective action. some technologies  such as cellular phones  have contributed directly to collective action by reducing the costs of political mobilisation by rebel or excluded groups. a technological shock primarily benefits a politically excluded or underrepresented group  a technological shock benefiting entrenched elites and incumbents would have the reverse effect of reinforcing the status quo.in many cases  incumbents lack the capacity to block or fail to anticipate the long run consequences of technological change  providing an opportunity to observe  political creative destruction  at work. history is replete with examples of technological innovations that had sweeping economic and political consequences that incumbents failed to block or anticipate. technological revolutions such as advances in shipping  the emergence of cities  or the industrial revolution  resulted in economic as well as political revolutions.in districts impacted by the green revolution  hyv crop cultivation revolutionised agricultural productivity  resulting in a transition from subsistence to commercialised agriculture. this benefited an increasingly wealthy  middle peasantry  comprised of typically lower  and intermediate caste farmers with sufficient landholdings and the economies of scale needed to take advantage of the new crop technology  a group that  according to various estimates  represented roughly    per cent of the indian population.not only was the middle peasantry increasingly wealthy  but  as in nearly all countries affected by the green revolution  increasingly dependent on government controlled economic policies. hyv crop cultivation required intensive use of inputs  including fertiliser and pesticide  electrification for operating tube wells  and equipment for mechanised cultivation. all of these inputs depended wholly or in part on government provision and subsidisation. moreover  the increased output of hyv crops placed downward pressure on crop market prices  making the level at which the government set crop procurement prices an increasingly visible issue affecting farmers  profits.these economic changes converted the previously quiescent countryside into a hotbed of political mobilisation.the growing articulation of the rural  voice  in the wake of the green revolution benefited agrarian and regional opposition parties because rural and cultivating caste groups were heavily underrepresented in the urban and elite dominated leadership of the congress party.by contrast  agrarian and regional opposition parties offered not only subsidies but descriptive representation for excluded rural groups. gaining representation in state legislatures was important to gaining direct control over agricultural policies. on a more quotidian level  gaining representation in local district party branches  district boards  local cooperative societies  and elected village councils was also important  because these district level institutions governed the local distribution of pesticide  fertiliser  agricultural credit  tube wells  seeds  and a variety of other inputs required for hyv crop cultivation.in addition to defeating the congress party at the state level  newly emergent agrarian and regional opposition parties played a pivotal role in the janata coalition  which defeated the congress party in national elections for the first time in india s history in     . by the     s  opposition parties drawing support from rural and cultivating caste groups had established multiparty competition in many of india s states  and also played an important role in the janata dal coalition  which defeated the congress party for the second time in parliamentary elections in       ushering in india s transition to multi party competition at the national level.the rural urban divide also corresponded to a conflict between cultivating  backward caste  groups and upper caste groups. caste associations provided an important basis for collective rural action. however  electoral institutions and ethnic rivalries cannot explain the timing of the congress party s decline  as elections and ethnic rivalries existed prior to as well as following the green revolution.it would be valuable to examine why some incumbent elites and parties are better at coping with disruptive technological change than others. the entrenched preexisting elites within the congress party may have inhibited it from strategically coopting rising rural groups outside of the party. this suggests that organisational entrenchment and flexibility are potentially important moderating factors affecting the linkage between technological change and political turnover  a hypothesis that deserves detailed exploration in future comparative research.the author is assistant professor of political science  university of california  merced. this is an edited extract from

black lives matter protests can work if they use gandhian tactics and stay peaceful
text size  a  a exactly one century ago  mohandas karamchand gandhi made a decision. he had decided that the british would not loosen control of india unless indians themselves took direct and decisive action. the manner of that action is what set gandhi  and the movement he subsequently led  apart. he chose to stop cooperating with an unjust state  to disobey unjust laws and throughout to pursue only non violent means of protest.plenty of indians who agreed with his goals disagreed with his ideas and his tactics. some of them resorted to violence. the debate that has today broken out in the united states over whether violence is ever acceptable in the fight for change is hardly a new one.many justifiably angry americans point out that multiple forms of non violent protest   from earlier marches to colin kaepernick s kneeling   have been tried. dr. martin luther king jr. talked about non violence  but wasn t he murdered  for that matter  wasn t gandhi  with truth and video evidence on their side  they ask   when we are non violent  they hit us anyway  so what s the point  that is  in fact  exactly the point. gandhian protest was not about stopping your oppressors from hitting you  it was about provoking them into doing so publicly and repellently. non violent protest could not be chosen by the weak  it was  in dr. king s own estimation  the only effective alternative to  cringing and submission. when americans debate non violent protest in moral terms  they miss the point. it is not a purely moral question  it is about both morality and tactics. gandhi and king were politicians who recognized that they needed to create demonstrations of will and also of moral superiority if they wanted to change minds. choosing violence instead  they argued  would only justify   in the oppressors  minds   further repression.of course  they understood the anger and desperation that leads to violence  as innumerable instagram accounts reminded us over the past week  dr. king famously said that  a riot is the language of the unheard.  yet that same speech included also a defense of  militant  powerful  massive non violence  as the most effective agent of change. violence  merely intensifies the fears of the white community while relieving the guilt. this is precisely the process that is playing out in the u.s. right now  which is why real civil rights icons are speaking out. rep. john lewis posted on his web site   rioting  looting  and burning is not the way. organize. demonstrate. sit in. stand up. vote. we are deeply grateful to our readers

tactically  non violence forces the perpetrators of violence   particularly  legitimate   state backed violence   onto the defensive. drama is key  it is through an obvious  dramatized contrast that

black lives matter protests can work if they use gandhian tactics and stay peaceful
text size  a  a exactly one century ago  mohandas karamchand gandhi made a decision. he had decided that the british would not loosen control of india unless indians themselves took direct and decisive action. the manner of that action is what set gandhi  and the movement he subsequently led  apart. he chose to stop cooperating with an unjust state  to disobey unjust laws and throughout to pursue only non violent means of protest.plenty of indians who agreed with his goals disagreed with his ideas and his tactics. some of them resorted to violence. the debate that has today broken out in the united states over whether violence is ever acceptable in the fight for change is hardly a new one.many justifiably angry americans point out that multiple forms of non violent protest   from earlier marches to colin kaepernick s kneeling   have been tried. dr. martin luther king jr. talked about non violence  but wasn t he murdered  for that matter  wasn t gandhi  with truth and video evidence on their side  they ask   when we are non violent  they hit us anyway  so what s the point  that is  in fact  exactly the point. gandhian protest was not about stopping your oppressors from hitting you  it was about provoking them into doing so publicly and repellently. non violent protest could not be chosen by the weak  it was  in dr. king s own estimation  the only effective alternative to  cringing and submission. when americans debate non violent protest in moral terms  they miss the point. it is not a purely moral question  it is about both morality and tactics. gandhi and king were politicians who recognized that they needed to create demonstrations of will and also of moral superiority if they wanted to change minds. choosing violence instead  they argued  would only justify   in the oppressors  minds   further repression.of course  they understood the anger and desperation that leads to violence  as innumerable instagram accounts reminded us over the past week  dr. king famously said that  a riot is the language of the unheard.  yet that same speech included also a defense of  militant  powerful  massive non violence  as the most effective agent of change. violence  merely intensifies the fears of the white community while relieving the guilt. this is precisely the process that is playing out in the u.s. right now  which is why real civil rights icons are speaking out. rep. john lewis posted on his web site   rioting  looting  and burning is not the way. organize. demonstrate. sit in. stand up. vote. we are deeply grateful to our readers

rahul gandhi s muslim outreach wants to win over liberals but alienates conservatives
text size  a  a the congress guest list had muslim liberals  left of centre intellectuals and professionals. but there were no muslim conservatives with contrarian views.after a spate of temple visits  rahul gandhi s move to court the muslim intelligentsia is welcome  but purely in terms of electoral strategy  rahul s wednesday initiative lacked clarity and a sense of purpose ahead of     .engaging with the muslim voter bloc is a good idea after his recent temple runs  but deletion of clergy and those with deep roots in society is inexplicable.the guest list was packed with liberals  left of centre intellectuals and professionals who have a common agenda of deep hatred towards the ruling nda  sympathy towards the nehru gandhi family and focus on the social left  welfare measures . there was little scope for contrarian views or showing a mirror to the congress leadership.on the face of it  strengthening liberal  moderate and modern views of a community is good. but for a political party that is keen to get as many votes as possible in       ignoring or alienating conservative sections of a community isn t smart politics.the pressures on the congress party is enormous.there is concern  sometimes exaggerated  within the muslim community over the growing cult of majoritarian power  a sharp decline in elected representation of muslims from panchayats to parliament  and the disturbing trend of lynching and cow vigilantism are some.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowbut there are also enough voices that caution against turning the      general elections into an    per cent vs    per cent contest. these apprehensions were floated after sonia gandhi remarked in mumbai that the bjp had managed to  convince  people that the congress was a  muslim party . she wanted to justify why rahul gandhi was visiting various hindu temples.the fact is that indian muslims accord great importance to faith. that is the reason why the all india muslim personal law board  aimplb  was able to collect crores of signatures against outlawing instant triple talaq  parade over a million burqa clad women on the streets and informally dissuade manmohan singh led upa to not scrap section    . the congress has failed to take a clear position on issues like the presence of mohammad ali jinnah portrait at the aligarh muslim university  amu   its support for the continuation of  internal quota  in professional seats in the amu  jamia and other minority run institutions.of course  much of the confusion over these issues begin at the congress  doorsteps where its governments deliberately left them unresolved. for instance  government files would not describe amu as a minority institution but say   believed to be formed by muslims in india . there is no explanation why successive congress regimes failed to reform or amend the muslim personal law  shariat  application act       to address contentious issues like alimony  polygamy and the age of consent.even on the issue of continuation and expansion of darul qaza  informal muslim family courts   the congress  stand remains ambiguous. while its minister for minorities affairs in karnataka has justified and welcomed it  the central congress leadership has chosen to be silent although it could have marshalled several arguments in its favour and why it allowed it to thrive for decades. pathetically  the grand old party is not even in a position to say that in a dynamic society  socio religious reforms must come from within the community  fearing political damaging. this ostrich like approach will leave the congress neither here nor there.the muslim chargesheet against the congress is rather long.the upa commissioned and produced the sachar commission report indicating poor socio economic conditions but did precious little to improve the situation. between      and       when the congress was mostly in power     major communal riots took place where several thousands lost their lives. most culprits from jabalpur  bhagalpur  hashimpura  bhiwandi  moradabad  and malyana went scot free. in december       former prime minister manmohan singh said minorities  particularly muslims  have the first claim on national resources  but throughout the upa rule muslims continued to be in the negative list in terms of getting loans from psu banks.the congress party machinery has remained a mute spectator in rajasthan  madhya pradesh  jharkhand and other places each time a lynching incident took place. no legal aid was extended to the victims  and there was no congress seva dal or the in house sadhbhavana ki sipahi expressing solidarity or marching towards the district collector s office. what we got instead was the issuance of press releases  tv statements and tweets.the present day congress leadership is eager to win any and every election. to achieve this feat  it wants to compete with the bjp in courting the majority community. at the same time  it does not want the likes of mamata banerjee  akhilesh yadav and mayawati to be the champions of minority rights. but the congress is falling between the two stools when it comes to the muslims.rahul would be better off learning from rajiv gandhi on how he had handled the shah bano case. he got a lot of flak but rajiv first welcomed the judgment and then began hearing the muslim ulemas who felt that the judgment was in conflict with the sharia. even as rajiv dithered      prominent muslims   liberals and those subscribing to the left of the centre ideology signed a memorandum asking rajiv to not change section     of the crpc and insisted that the right of divorced muslim women to claim maintenance from their husband and former husbands be preserved. some of these signatories were prof. rais ahmad  ali sardar jafri  abid husain  prof. irfan habib  khwaja ahmad abbas  prof. moonis raza  prof. rasheeduddin khan  badruddin tyabji  javed akhtar  shabana azmi  and saeed mirza.rajiv panicked  having been caught between liberal and conservative sections of muslims. he finally sided with the clergy and got muslim women  protection of rights of divorced women  bill passed to overturn the supreme court verdict. some elements within the congress still regret that course of action.engaging a community is always welcome but a political cost analysis is important particularly when crucial general elections are around the corner.rasheed kidwai is

remember vajpayee nehru episode  that is why congress must let modi off the hook on china
text size  a  a the ongoing india china border stand off provides the opposition a perfect opportunity to corner the narendra modi government on national security  widely considered its trump card. you can hardly blame the congress for giving in to the temptation of returning the compliment paid by atal bihari vajpayee to jawaharlal nehru following the debacle of     . yet  the opposition must resist this temptation. national interest must trump party interest. pm modi must be let off the hook  not because he deserves to  but because not doing so would hurt all of us  collectively.i am no expert on strategic affairs or india china relationship. thankfully  there are many clearheaded  uncensored accounts  explanations and analyses of what s happening on the ground and its larger implications for india china relations. the need of the hour is to learn from expert views and come to a political judgement. this is a moment to look beyond this crisis  to look beyond petty partisan gains  to look at the long term national interest  before things go out of hand.also read  not china       war called india s bluffthere is a chinese designthe big picture is fairly clear. india faces the most serious chinese incursion in the last few decades. this is not one of the routine summer standoffs in this region between the indian army and china s people s liberation army  pla . nor is it an acute but localised standoff like doklam in       triggered by a local provocation. this is a premeditated intrusion at multiple points falling in different army zones. thousands of chinese soldiers  about        by this estimate  have entered our side of the line of actual control  lac   including areas that were so far routinely patrolled by indian troops and acknowledged by china to be on the indian side. the chinese have displayed an unmistakable intent to stay put. they have dug trenches  put up tents  brought vehicles  built roads  and fortified themselves on their side of the border. this is a calculated move to alter the lac in some critical sectors by the sheer force of adverse possession.we don t quite know why. unlike in the case of doklam standoff  the chinese have not cared to acknowledge their incursion  let along spell out its reason. but we can be sure that the chinese state does not take such steps in a fit of absent mindedness or as a knee jerk reaction to some provocation. this must fit into a long term design. it is lazy to see this as an expression of chinese expansionism. is this a focused warning to india against building infrastructure on its own side of the lac to catch up with china s build up  are the chinese responding to the new map of ladakh post the reorganisation of jammu and kashmir  or is it a much larger message to warn india against joining the us led anti china coalition  or a bit of all of the above perhaps  we will never find out  because the chinese state does not believe in spelling out its intent. so  we have to go by its actions. and the actions must invite worry. the real long term national security threat to india comes not from pakistan or any other unfriendly neighbour. the one entity we must worry about is the chinese state with its economic and military might and a capacity to think and plan long term and with whom we share a long and fuzzy border.also read  the chinese are so predictable  modi   shah should ve seen them coming on   august     we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowthere is a goof up on the indian sideit is also clear that there has been a goof up at the indian end. we don t know who exactly  but either the local commander or the higher ups failed to anticipate and quickly respond to the chinese incursion on time. chinese troops now have the first mover s advantage. although the indian army has responded by increasing its presence  the pla has more legs and better infrastructure on the ground.frankly  there is little that indian forces can do now to eject the chinese troops  and gun battle is not an option. china enjoys ground advantage besides its undeniable overall military and economic superiority. china is not pakistan  you cannot think of a balakot like surgical operation. the only option is negotiation and persuasion  something the chinese are not overly keen on. diplomatic pressure does not work on china. in any case  the modi government has managed to annoy almost every one of india s neighbours  including traditional friends such as sri lanka  bangladesh  and nepal. a mix of ignorance and arrogance is taking its toll on india s relations with its neighbours.faced with this hard reality  the political leadership is all thumbs. no matter who has goofed up  the buck must stop with the defence minister  if not the prime minister s office  pmo . the indian army is trying to live in denial  pretending that the chinese are not changing the status quo of the lac. the usual hawkish nationalist brigade has its lips sealed  except a silly call to boycott chinese goods.defence minister rajnath singh appears to have weakened the indian case by first saying that the lac is not clearly demarcated and then making a convoluted acknowledgement of the chinese intrusion. he is yet to object to the chinese troops crossing the lac or assert india s claim on the area being usurped. pm modi has maintained a stony silence and appears to have done what he does in any such crisis  depute national security adviser ajit doval to sort out this mess. fortunately  for the pm  the media is not asking hard questions  not yet. but this cannot go on for long. someone is going to ask the uncomfortable question about the modi government acquiescing to a chinese  occupation .this is exactly what atal bihari vajpayee had indicted jawaharlal nehru for  speaking in the rajya sabha on   november       just after the humiliation in arunachal pradesh. the congress could return the compliment. rahul gandhi has already demanded that the government  come clean  on the situation on the border. he is hitting modi where it would hurt his carefully crafted image of an iron man. this displays neither courage nor competence. this mess also attests to a personal failure of the pm s famous  jhoola  swing  diplomacy   with chinese president xi jinping. the comic intervention by his friend and us president donald trump should also embarrass modi  notwithstanding the latest phone call.also read  no chinese  occupation . geolocated images show fast in and out intrusions by india and china national interest  must come firstyet  this is one moment when the congress led opposition must resist the temptation to attack the modi government. we are in the midst of a national health emergency brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. a political attack on the government on the issue of national security cannot but distract the government from whatever little it is doing to address this emergency.we are also in the middle of the biggest economic crisis any single event has induced in the history of post independence india. any military engagement  or even preparation for military engagement  would bleed the indian economy in a way that the country cannot afford. above all  a pressure from the opposition would force the modi government into a knee jerk reaction or an amateurish adventure that can only hurt our national interest. the only way to respond to this long term design of china is to give our government the room to come up with a well thought out response at a time of its choosing.this is one of the rare moments to safeguard a much abused term  national interest. pm modi must demonstrate his commitment to national interest by taking key opposition leaders into confidence. the opposition must demonstrate it by letting him off the hook.the author is the national president of swaraj india. views are personal.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis   only you can fix it you are reading this

section     exposes bjp and congress  doublespeak on homosexuality
text size  a  a govts refusing to take stand on section     have no right to accuse judiciary of overreach.in refusing to take a stand on decriminalising homosexuality  the modi government  politically speaking  finds itself in a win win situation.by leaving it to the  wisdom of the court   the government has actually conveyed a lot more than what is in its three page affidavit to the supreme court. the subtext is that while the government is okay with giving equal rights to the lgbtq  it cannot say so in as many words.this basically ensures that international headlines do not label the modi government as homophobic   it is politically convenient for the party and also allows the government to get what it wants by just playing a silent spectator.if the law is declared unconstitutional  the bjp can direct the backlash from its conservative vote bank to the court. it can always hide behind the fact that it was the court that legitimised same sex relations  and not the government.on the other hand  if the      experience repeats itself and section     is validated once again  then the bjp can claim moral high ground by saying that it always supported abolishing the law.unfortunately  it is not just the bjp led government that is afraid of taking a stand on this issue. the lgbtq issue does not seem to fit into the political narrative of any party.we are

future. subscribe nowthe doublespeak by the liberal congress led upa government in the earlier cases is also hard to miss.in       when the delhi high court was hearing the naz foundation case  two ministries filed completely contradictory views. while the ministry of home affairs was opposed to striking down the law because homosexuality cannot be  morally condoned   the ministry of health and family welfare argued that section     is counter productive to the efforts of hiv aids prevention and treatment.the high court  however  went on to declare the law unconstitutional. it was only then that the upa government came out in full support of legalising same sex relationships.once celebrations had begun  it could not have afforded to offend liberal sentiments.so  when religious groups challenged the high court ruling before the supreme court  the government refused to defend the law and said it found no fault with the high court verdict. attorney general goolam vahanvati stood up in court saying his conscience would not permit him to argue in favour of retaining section    .in fact  the congress government was the first one to seek a review of the disappointing sc ruling that upheld section    . rulings are rarely reversed even when the court reviews them. in       the review petition was dismissed by thesupreme court.despite the dismissal  the upa government did not take any steps legislatively  through an amendment or an ordinance  to remove section     from the books.the current case will surely fly without the government s assistance. each of the lawyers representing the petitioners has passionate pleas to make to the court.successive governments seem to have ducked the question on homosexuality. but here s an important question   can the governments refuse to take a stand on issues involving human rights and delegate their role to the courts  if they do  do they get to then criticise the judiciary for overreach subscribe to our channels on

only reason why narendra modi will return in      is rahul gandhi
text size  a  a the congress president is not even trying to win the next lok sabha elections.in a one to one war  neither side has to be the world s best army. both could be uninspiring. the better one will win.when you think of the world s best cricket teams  you will not think of bangladesh. yet  in a match with zimbabwe  bangladesh will win easily. you don t have to be the best team  you only need to be better than your rival.going into the      lok sabha elections  the narendra modi led bharatiya janata party  bjp  is not the best team. but it appears to be better than the congress. koi bhi chalega for many of the nearly    per cent religious minorities  and a handful of left liberals   anybody  may be better than modi bjp and  therefore  rahul gandhi is acceptable.  koi bhi chalega   is what you ll hear from them. anybody will do.we ve seen this movie before  they wanted  anybody but modi  in       just as liberals in the us wanted  anybody but trump .the problem with  anybody but trump  was that it didn t mean  hillary would be a great president . similarly  even those who say  anybody but modi  are not heard saying  rahul gandhi would make a great prime minister .we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowin four years since his party dropped to a historic low  rahul gandhi has not been able to convince voters that he has a vision for the people of the country. gandhi and his party have failed to persuade voters that they can deliver good governance. in the last four years  the congress has not been able to defeat the bjp in any major election  whereas the regional parties have shown some ability to do that. aur hai kaun  three words are often heard these days in defence of prime minister narendra modi.  aur hai kaun   or  who s the alternative  mind you  this line comes from modi s supporters  not his critics.if taken at face value  the question reflects a desire for a better alternative that is missing. rahul gandhi has clearly failed to be that alternative.if taken as rhetoric  the question  aur hain kaun   is at least an acknowledgement that narendra modi has not delivered the achhe din  the good days he promised in     .modi today is not half as strong as       when he could say anything and get away with it. his outlandish claims  the impossible dreams he showed  made him sound like just the man people needed. such was the faith he inspired that calling him feku didn t work.modi could occupy such a position not only because he was campaigning against the worst government in recent memory  upa    but also because he had sold the story of his achievements in gujarat.today  however  modi is much diminished since     . he does not have the advantage of being the challenger to an unpopular government. he is facing  at the very least  anti incumbency. he is so short of achievements to sell that he has to attack the congress as if the congress was still in power.from foreign policy to farmers  from jobs to gst  he is looking weak on all fronts.a right to information query has revealed the ganga is more polluted now than it was in       when modi had made tall promises of cleaning up the river.the bullet train project he promised has just about kicked off with the commissioning of its first bridge. his party has alienated dalits  and big businesses crib in private. which section of society exactly is happy with him in the face of such criticism  the modi supporter s last answer is  aur hai kaun  not even tryingthere have been countless protests by farmers across the country in the last few years  some of which have been mobilised by left linked farmers  associations. farmers  discontent  and not the patel agitation  was why the bjp was routed in rural gujarat.if india had a real opposition  we would have seen a large farmers  protest in delhi bringing the government to its knees  like the lokpal movement did to upa   in     . if instead of gandhi we had a real opposition leader  he would have collected farmers  leaders from across the country and sat on an indefinite hunger strike at the ramlila maidan.instead  gandhi goes here and there  especially during state elections  addresses farmers and then runs off to europe. he gave one speech in mandsaur about farmers  rights and then he was off to london or wherever. had he been agitating for farmers and not holidaying in europe in june  he would have been able to take credit for the modi government s increase in the minimum support prices.the congress party s eminent lawyers saved the day in karnataka but instead of overseeing the formation of a smooth coalition cabinet  gandhi was abroad. he gave an iftar party but forgot to invite opposition leaders. he said coca cola emerged from shikanji and reminded people of his  pappu  image.under his leadership  his party organised a midnight protest against the kathua and unnao rape cases. the protest was so badly organised that priyanka gandhi lost her cool at people who were pushing and shoving around. gandhi can t even organise a protest at india gate properly. can he really run the country organising a good protest and a politically astute iftar  or making a good speech needs advance planning. the only thing gandhi plans well is his europe holidays.four and a half months after the congress working committee was dissolved  gandhi hasn t been able to create a new one. it s the party s highest decision making body.it s been nearly    months since the bihar congress has not had a chief  there is an acting head . can you imagine the bjp leaving such a crucial state  or any state  faceless for months what role is gandhi playing in up  what is his intervention in the ongoing political churning in bihar  what is he doing about addressing the gehlot versus pilot factionalism in rajasthan in at least     lok sabha seats  there will be a direct contest between the bjp and the congress. this is where the bjp will see its best performance  as it did in     .modi may be looking like a poor shadow of his      self  but gandhi is not even trying to defeat him.gandhi thinks power will fall in his lap whenever people are bored with the bjp. if that happens in      or       so be it. why should he try hard subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis   only you can fix it you are reading this because you value good  intelligent and objective

ajit jogi played in congress  big boy league  convinced each camp he was their  utility  man
text size  a  a ajit pramod kumar jogi s life journey went from a poverty stricken tribal childhood to ips  ias and then to the congress party. it was a meteoric rise.but his political life was full of contradictions  and one of unrealised potential.ajit jogi was instinctively anti brahminical  yet he chose arjun singh  pranab mukherjee  and p.v. narasimha rao as his  role  models  all masters in machiavellian politics and the congress  famed palace intrigue. jogi wasn t a palace manoeuverer but tried very hard to play to the congress camps. he tried to play in the congress  big boy league. in spite of his powerful mentors  he had to fend for himself until the end. he fancied himself as a mass leader  which he was not.at the height of his political career  ajit jogi met with an accident that reduced his chances of a comeback. in the caste matrix  he had to struggle between a tribal and a satnami harijan for most of his political life. even after earning several reprieves from courts  chhattisgarh police registered an fir against him in september      for allegedly possessing a fake caste certificate.also read  bjp banking on one leader to win chhattisgarh   it s actually ajit

congress dynamics in the late     s were so intricate that then prime minister and congress president rajiv gandhi picked  outsider  jogi instead of considering nominees recommended by arjun singh  shukla brothers  p.c. sethi  madhavrao scindia and a galaxy of other leaders from that era.jogi joined rajiv gandhi s  shouting brigade  in the rajya sabha. this was the time the former prime minister was facing opposition onslaught over the bofors scandal. along with ratnakar pandey  suresh pachauri  s.p.  baba  mishra  and s.s. ahluwalia  jogi too developed a penchant for pouncing upon anyone daring to speak against rajiv or sonia gandhi. after rajiv gandhi was assassinated in       the group tried hard to prevail upon sonia to take over the congress.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowrajiv s assassination was a setback for ajit jogi. that s when he began to court arjun singh  narasimha rao  pranab mukherjee  and sonia gandhi s private secretary vincent george. jogi had successfully convinced each one of them that they had his complete loyalty. jogi selectively used information to project himself as a  utility  man. when arjun singh had a tiff with rao  he viewed jogi as his  mole  in rao camp. and rao s crisis managers relied on jogi for a similar role in arjun singh camp.ajit jogi s brush with this power play made him more ambitious. by this time  he had become all india congress committee  aicc  spokesperson with daily and easy access to media  which used to troop in every day at   pm at     akbar road. jogi was a popular spokesman  always measured with words. reporters saw a different man in his daily off the record briefings conducted inside congress headquarters and later at his shahjahan road residence. the passport to these briefings was strictly based on confidentiality and on the individual reporter s ability to reproduce the  jogi version .when narasimha rao got phased out  ajit jogi became a regular at new aicc chief sitaram kesri s    purana qila residence. after several attempts  jogi finally found a sympathetic ear. this rattled congress leader and madhya pradesh s then chief minister digvijaya singh.jogi liked telling tales about  diggy raja  whom he loved to hate  and often mixed facts  fiction  fantasy. a reporter once narrated jogi s tales to digvijaya singh  which led to a bitter confrontation between the two leaders that was audible to a select few media representatives. jogi put digvijaya s landline call on speaker phone and one could hear the chief minister reminding him   congress office ki pavitrata  garima toh na kharab kar  do not violate the sanctity of the congress office . jogi  dileep singh bhuria  who had been the ratlam mp since      and eventually shifted to the bjp   aslam sher khan  hockey olympian  and others tried to find a foothold in madhya pradesh politics but digvijaya singh was firm. when two groups of ruling congress clashed in bhopal  jogi accused digvijaya camp of unleashing   suar maar bomb   which is used by nomadic tribes for hunting wild pigs.also read  mayawati jogi alliance is the joker in the chhattisgarh poll packa new state  a new lifeluck finally smiled on ajit jogi when

the support of a dozen congress mlas  but a number of christian clergy  tribal leaders  and thinkers reportedly lined up for him. chhattisgarh veteran vidya charan shukla thought himself to be a favourite but sonia gandhi was disinclined to oblige shukla on grounds of betraying indira gandhi after the      lok sabha election debacle and raising the bofors bogey during rao s time when he was the parliamentary affairs minister.a crucial meeting was held at     janpath to decide who will be chhattisgarh s first chief minister. a handful of reporters saw congress leaders coming out and jogi bending to touch digvijaya singh s feet. by the time jogi reached next door  at     akbar road  he had another spin   we have been friends and colleagues. so whenever we meet  we try to rattle each other just like school college boys do. years later  digvijaya recalled at bhopal s indian coffee house that jogi had promised  life long  gratitude to him.  it ended by the time jogi swearing in took place in raipur and i returned to bhopal   digvijaya had said with a trademark chuckle.the creation of chhattisgarh was painful for digvijaya singh. apart from the fact that a large chunk of madhya pradesh was bifurcated and his detractor jogi had become at par with him as chief minister of a congress ruled state  digvijaya had to face some blows too.i was in raipur on   november      when ghulam nabi azad  who was aicc observer  gave a quote that was published in the telegraph   when we finalised the clp leader s name in the forenoon we thought our task was over. we were planning to watch mission kashmir till we realised we had a more important task   mission chhattisgarh.  there was even a fistfight between supporters of v.c. shukla and digvijaya singh  resulting in the chief minister receiving some kicks and punches.jogi s tenure as chhattisgarh chief minister was lacklustre and by december       the congress was out of power. in april       jogi  during his lok sabha campaign for mahasamund seat against shukla  suffered a near fatal accident. he survived but for the rest of his life  he had to use a wheelchair.during the      lok sabha election campaign  narendra

finalising a marriage proposal but later switched sisters by bringing in the one with disability  jogi  for the marriage ceremony   reported the new indian express.but ajit jogi was determined to stage a comeback after his stem cell therapy  having suffered a heart attack in      . he aligned with mayawati of the bahujan samaj party  bsp  after having floated a party of his own  janta congress chhattisgarh. his exit from the congress paved the way for a spectacular electoral victory for the grand old party. jogi never reconciled to it.the author is a visiting fellow at orf and working on a

maharashtra paying a price in covid because uddhav thackeray and rahul gandhi stole mandate
text size  a  a the sheer magnitude of devastation that maharashtra has witnessed due to a non performing conglomeration of rank opportunists  makes it an imperative for india to have a law to bar pilfering of public mandate in the future.consider this side a and side b were locked in the final of a cricket tournament. side a won the match with a decent enough contribution from a batsman called uddhav thackeray. but in the end  uddhav was adamant that he be declared the team captain before the prize distribution ceremony. when his demand was not met  uddhav transferred his half century to side b and ensured a losing team was declared the winner.the kind of wretched promiscuity that had gone into the formation of the unnatural maha vikas aghadi government in maharashtra has been clearly visible throughout the coronavirus crisis. not once have the three parties   the shiv sena  the congress and the nationalist congress party   acted in unison.while congress leader rahul gandhi and his colleague  former maharashtra chief minister prithviraj chavan  have clearly shrugged off the party s responsibility for the maharashtra fiasco  ncp leaders such as state home minister anil deshmukh have been clueless non performers  aggravating the crisis manifold. the role of the cunning sharad pawar is mired in speculation. he has had long meetings with chief minister uddhav thackeray  but we don t know if the meetings were to offer positive inputs or to manipulate the government to extract gains for the ncp.all said and done and despite cm thackeray s belaboured but hollow facebook lives  the covid    situation in maharashtra has not improved at all in the past two months. today  maharashtra contributes over    per cent of the total coronavirus cases in india  it records more than       new cases on an average every day. maharashtra s covid    mortality rate is  .   per cent  above the national average of  .   per cent. the state has reported unimaginable medical horrors where patients have died waiting for icu beds.the onus for this failure clearly lies upon cm thackeray s ineptitude and his clumsy notions about the chair he holds  just as it does upon the unnatural alliance wherein governance was never even remotely on the agenda.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowalso read   tears  to tweets   why piyush goyal s throwing everything he s got to fight shramik pr messcommunication breakdown with alliance partnerswhat has been cm thackeray s schedule during the lockdown  there is barely any evidence of him communicating regularly with fellow ministers or bureaucrats and taking stock of the situation on a regular basis. no wonder then that while the cm announced on his facebook live on    may that maharashtra was not ready for flight operations yet  by evening  his cabinet colleague  minister nawab malik had confirmed    flight operations for next day. when railway minister piyush goyal called out the cm s bluff on the issue of trains not being provided for migrants  the cm didn t have a response.ias lobby calling the shotsthe absence of political leadership through the covid    crisis in maharashtra is corroborated by none other than congress leader prithviraj chavan. it seems that the state government is unaware of the powers and functions of the second tier of government and instead wants to put the third tier   the brihanmumbai municipal corporation  bmc    at the front. this abdication of responsibility on the part of the state government is utterly shocking.also read  bjp using raj bhavans as den of politics in states where it s out of power  says nawab malikconfrontationist attitude towards centreevery time questions have been raised about the state government s failures  uddhav thackeray has blamed the narendra modi government at the centre for not providing adequate funds to the state. his lie was eventually exposed by former chief minister devendra fadnavis with facts and figures  to which the cm or his government had no response.the fact is that an alarmingly high number of migrant labourers did not get any ration from the state government during the lockdown  due to which most were forced into leaving the state for their native places.the horrors that maharashtra has witnessed on account of the state government s apathy is going to remain etched in public memory for a very long time. what made the situation unpardonably cringeworthy was rahul gandhi s admission that his party is not the decision maker in maharashtra. in many ways  it was an admission that all the three parties in alliance are solely there to fill up their party coffers for the long years of hibernation that lies ahead of them.also read  how mumbai raj bhavan has become centre of political activity amid maharashtra covid crisisthe  unnatural  alliancethe devastation that the shiv sena congress ncp government has wreaked upon maharashtra demands that we take a larger view of the situation. a westminster democracy often makes a mockery of numbers. we have seen it happen in      when h.d. deve gowda  who wouldn t have imagined himself being a national leader ever  overnight became prime minister of a grossly opportunist government  which derailed india s development agenda. what happened in maharashtra in      was far worse  stealing a mandate by swapping partners   a misadventure that drove maharashtra into the tragic mess it finds itself in today.we  therefore  ideally need a law    prevention of subversion of public mandate act    to prevent such damage in future. in the absence of the prerequisite majority for a pre poll alliance for whatsoever reasons  the threshold for government formation should be brought down to winning    per cent of the seats.we have seen the minority government of p.v. narasimha rao perform remarkably well in       whereas an unnatural alliance fail in     . the maha vikas aghadi alliance is so unnatural that its partners are never sure

rahul gandhi s congress appointments reveal strategy   win or lose       gear up for     
text size  a  a rahul gandhi is trying for a smooth transition in the party order  as the old guard must be accommodated at least until     .soon after he was elected party president in december       rahul gandhi declared  there are going to be new  exciting faces in the congress .exciting or not  he has certainly handpicked some fresh faces to include in his team  which some congress leaders call a  work in progress  because he only announces names in instalments. this new team is tasked with challenging the bjp in the year end assembly polls and next year s lok sabha polls.selecting the team has been a process closely monitored by his office  while gandhi himself has interviewed the successful candidates. he has also conducted individual meetings with    state representatives in the last few months.no cwc yethowever  gandhi is yet to fill up some of the top posts in the party. even four months after the all india congress committee plenary session  the congress working committee  cwc  has not been re constituted. an ad hoc steering committee continues instead. some general secretary and state in charge posts also remain empty  no name has been announced as the successor to ahmed patel as political secretary either.this is a departure from the past  when any new congress president used to begin his her tenure with the list of cwc members     of the    members are traditionally elected by aicc delegates while the president nominates the others . gandhi  however  went along with the old guard  who advised him to take the nomination route   as a result  the    march aicc plenary authorised him to nominate all the members. possibly  this advice was given to ensure that gandhi s leadership was not undermined at this early stage.in the absence of the cwc  some wonder how gandhi did not consult even the steering committee on crucial decisions like lending support to the jd s  to form the government in karnataka  or the kashmir issue.we are deeply grateful to our

nowdifficult to ignore old guardgandhi s new team is a blend of the old guard and gen next  as he has realised the old guard cannot be ignored. but he has been ruthless in dumping senior leaders like janardhan dwivedi  b.k. hari prasad  mohan prakash  digvijaya singh  among others. even ahmed patel s influence has reduced significantly.it is not clear how gandhi plans to utilise leaders like a.k. antony  shivraj patil  virbhadra singh  bhupinder singh hooda  jairam ramesh  salman khurshid  sheila dikshit and ambika soni.unlike earlier  when one general secretary would handle three or four states  newly appointed state in charges just work in one province  assisted by three secretaries. they are supposed to spend at least    days in their respective states and cover booth level management.gandhi s inner circlegandhi has made some significant appointments by putting his confidants in important posts. he has made his close aides rajeev satav and jitendra singh the persons in charge of gujarat and odisha respectively  and named amit chavda as the new gujarat unit chief. niranjan patnaik is the new odisha pcc chief. gujarat leader shaktisinh gohil is in charge of bihar  and anugrah narayan singh of uttarakhand. deepak babaria is the new general secretary in charge of madhya pradesh and sushmita dev the chief of the mahila congress.among the seniors  former prime minister manmohan singh is the head of the jammu and kashmir and northeast coordination committees. kumari selja is the election committee in charge of rajasthan  while gandhi s trusted aide madhusudan mistry holds this post in madhya pradesh.the party s leader in lok sabha mallikarjun kharge is general secretary in charge of maharashtra and former kerala chief minister oommen chandy is in charge of andhra pradesh. former rajasthan chief minister ashok gehlot is the organisational general secretary  while technocrat sam pitroda  who was close to rajiv gandhi  has been appointed chairman of the overseas congress. professor rajeev gowda  a rajya sabha mp  heads the party think tank.in madhya pradesh  old warhorse kamal nath is the new pradesh congress chief. the pcc chiefs for some states like kerala  up and haryana are still pending.among the younger lot  randeep singh surjewala  milind deora  ajay maken  sachin pilot  divya spandana  sushmita dev and r.p.n. singh are the rising stars. gandhi takes the advice of senior leaders like ghulam nabi azad  p. chidambaram  anand sharma and ahmed patel on issues. but his core team remains mother and former congress chief sonia  sister priyanka and himself.the new driving force behind the party is gandhi s own office  headed by kopulla raju  a retired      batch ias officer. kanishk singh  gandhi s former secretary  is now tipped to succeed motilal vora as party treasurer. alankar sawai is in charge of documentation and research and former actress divya spandana is heading the social media team.gandhi wants his team to be tech savvy and keep a low profile. he has given a clear message that no one with any baggage will be in his new team.what to expectwill this team produce results  that s the million dollar question  as the list is not complete and there is not much time. gandhi is trying for a smooth transition  as the old guard must be accommodated at least until     .the strategy is clear   win or lose       there is a mega

  reasons why congress will never ally with mehbooba mufti s pdp
text size  a  a the congress has still not forgotten the humiliation it suffered in     .mehbooba mufti is a strong woman who  many would know  took the lead over her father  the late mufti mohammad sayeed  in building the peoples democratic party  pdp  from the scratch.if sayeed was the strategist  the brain of the party  mehbooba was the able lieutenant  the volatile but extremely street smart rabble rouser. she understood well that reaching out to families of those bearing the brunt of the  struggle  in militancy hit kashmir would translate into votes.when her father walked out of the congress in         along with some of his colleagues to form a regional party  mehbooba  then an mla  followed suit.she became the public and aggressive face of the fledgling party  in sharp contrast to her more nuanced and suave father who was more at ease cutting political deals and stitching alliances than her.this fact   that she is aggressive and better at protests and rallying   became her nemesis when she took over as the chief minister of jammu and kashmir after the death of her father.to begin with  she didn t have the political cunning of her late father to face the challenges a tie up with the bjp brought. under mehbooba  the pdp s alliance with the bjp was a disaster in waiting for both  but especially for the party from the valley.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nownow  with reports suggesting that the pdp is trying to entice the congress into a fresh alliance  here are four main reasons why it will not happen  at least in the immediate future congress will not want to lose ncany tie up with the pdp would mean an end to what promises to be a mutually beneficial and profitable alliance between the congress and the national conference  nc . during her two year stint as the chief minister  mehbooba was unable to do much for her core constituency of pro separatist kashmiris due to the constraints of her alliance with the bjp.in the meantime  the nc has seen a remarkable upswing in its support. omar abdullah  once seen by many as a reluctant politician unlike mehbooba  has emerged as a leader in his own right. he has played his cards well  although he still has a long way to go. omar has successfully ensured that the nc capitalised on mehbooba s failure to deliver on the development front or prevent killings in the valley. with the nc as its partner  the congress can also hope to gain more in terms of seats.why bear the burden of pdp s anti incumbency for the congress  any tie up with the pdp would also mean that the party would have to share the anti incumbency that is prevailing across the state against mehbooba. the mood in the valley is against the pdp and any tie up with it could mean that the congress will lose out on the chance to improve its standing in the region whenever fresh elections are held. ditto for the jammu region where mehbooba is not the flavour of the season by a long shot.such an alliance will help the bjpafter the rape murder of the eight year old girl in kathua  the sentiment in hindu majority jammu has turned against mehbooba  courtesy the public speeches by the bjp leaders  particularly former minister lal singh.a tie up with her party could result in jammuites sticking with the bjp. despite its grandstanding and public statements after the break up  the bjp has not been forgiven by the people of jammu  many of whom continue to accuse the party of having bartered jammu s interests for power. more importantly   this could be a winner for the congress   many bjp ministers were seen as incompetent and corrupt.if it ties up with the pdp  the congress could end up alienating the hindu voters of jammu  who overwhelmingly voted for the bjp in the      assembly election.voters in jammu  many feel  are ready to return to the congress fold  but any tie up with the pdp will only scare them away.congress hasn t forgotten     in       sayeed joined hands with the congress to form the government in the

urgent question facing rahul gandhi  whom to pick as congress leader in lok sabha 
text size  a  a the congress president can appoint himself  deputy leader jyotiraditya scindia  or even stick with incumbent veteran mallikarjun kharge.rahul gandhi faces a difficult choice in the appointment of new leader of the congress in the lok sabha. the aicc chief is himself a contender  with an eye on next year s lok sabha polls  and also has the option of elevating jyotiraditya scindia  the young and dynamic deputy leader of the party in the lok sabha.the issue came up when gandhi appointed current leader mallikarjun kharge as the party s general secretary in charge of maharashtra. kharge  the    year old veteran from karnataka  is seen in party circles as an insipid performer  and is thought to be incapable of performing this double duty  since the maharashtra assembly polls are scheduled just months after next year s lok sabha elections. the congress also might want to live up to its  one person  one post  tradition  though right now  the party s leader in the rajya sabha  ghulam nabi azad  is also in charge of its affairs in tamil nadu. one person  one post  has always been a controversial principle  and has led to many titanic battles within the party. the last time the congress witnessed a major row over the issue was when a motley group led by arjun singh had unsuccessfully tried to get the principle implemented on prime minister p.v. narasimha rao  who was also the congress president.arguments for and against gandhiif gandhi himself replaces kharge  the move is bound to come under criticism from various quarters for a range of reasons.flouting  one person  one post  would be one criticism  while another would be that he would be the second member of his family to hold an important parliamentary post   mother sonia gandhi is the current chairperson of the congress parliamentary party  cpp . as per the congress constitution  the cpp chairperson has the power to appoint the party s leaders in both houses  and for some  it would be bad optics that a mother who vacated the party president s post for her son in december      would consolidate his position by appointing him leader in the lok sabha.also  in the context of social and political realities  rahul gandhi replacing dalit leader kharge is bound to raise eyebrows in certain quarters.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowon the plus side  gandhi taking on the mantle would send out a strong signal that in the      polls  he alone will be the contender for the prime minister s post. this message would hold more significance outside the congress  particularly among the third front protagonists who believe he is  not serious  for     .the case for scindiaa section of the party feels the elevation of jyotiraditya scindia as the leader of the congress in the lok sabha would be apt. scindia  a reasonably good orator in both hindi and english  has wider acceptability that goes beyond the congress family. being given responsibility in delhi would provide much needed breathing space for madhya pradesh congress chief kamal nath  who is trying to topple the shivraj singh chouhan led bjp regime in madhya pradesh  which has been in power for    years. the mp polls are due in november this year  and for a majority of congress workers there  the presence of both scindia and nath leads to confusion about the party s chief ministerial candidate. nath s supporters are rooting for the nine time mp from chhindwara  while supporters of scindia  the head of the mp congress committee s campaign panel  want party mlas to be free to choose between the leaders in the event of victory.deadline approachingthe issue of the congress leadership in the lok sabha needs to be settled fast  as the monsoon session of parliament is set to begin    july  while there is also constant speculation that the general elections may be advanced or clubbed with the assembly polls of madhya pradesh  rajasthan  chhattisgarh and mizoram.rahul gandhi needs to take a call soon  to signal the party s and his own preparedness. a decision on kharge s replacement or continuation  therefore  has an informal    july deadline.rasheed kidwai is an observer research foundation visiting fellow

everyone travels  so why are we worked up over rahul gandhi s holidays 
text size  a  a rahul gandhi is the face of the congress. his words and actions have a bearing on what people think about the party.congressmen are clueless about the whereabouts of rahul gandhi  their party president. they saw him last on    june  a day after his   th birthday that he celebrated in india this year.he loves discovering the world  but his foreign vacations right before or after his birthday have been a mystery  especially because of the secrecy surrounding the destination. the nda government has frequently accused him of neglecting the security protocol.on his   th birthday  gandhi was in italy. on the   th  he was in india but left for a  short trip  abroad the very next day. he celebrated his   th birthday in india  a few weeks after he returned from a    day sabbatical abroad. he went out of the country to celebrate his   th birthday  which came just a month after his party was reduced to a tally of    in the lok sabha.so  does rahul gandhi s preference for exotic locales for a break make him a non serious politician as his political adversaries would have us believe  there is no black or white answer to that.samajwadi party leader akhilesh yadav is in london along with his family but nobody is cribbing. check up on others across the political spectrum  and you may appreciate the international exposure our political class enjoys. even atal bihari vajpayee used to go on vacations  although within the country. so  why this fuss over gandhi holidaying some of the blame may lie in his packaging as a leader  an idealist who could embarrass his own party and the prime minister for seeking to bring an ordinance to save tainted politicians like lalu yadav  an angry young man who denounced the  system   in both the congress and the government  developed and safeguarded by his senior party colleagues and forefathers  and a rebel who stalled a big mining project in odisha to  help  the tribals of niyamgiri hills even though it meant condemning them to poverty forever. how could such a leader  like other ordinary mortals  take a break and go abroad we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowon a leisurely winter afternoon in       gandhi  then congress vice president  was interacting with a group of journos. they were asking him about his plans to arrest the continuous erosion in his party s support base. how will you do it when you don t have popular regional leaders who could disseminate your party s ideology and programmes at the grassroots  the congress doesn t have such faces in states   asked an intrepid reporter.gandhi heard her patiently  brooded over it for a few seconds  and then replied   it s not about faces  it s about the congress ideology. sometimes  even one person can become the symbol of what the party stands for. nehruji was the face. indiraji was the face.  nehruji went to jail several times during the freedom struggle  but you don t have to go there to become the face   he added with a smile.he left many things unsaid but the message wasn t lost on anyone. five years since then  one doesn t know whether gandhi holds the same view. many things have changed. the congress is out of power at the centre and decimated in most states. congressmen now talk about a battle of ideologies   and not between personalities   in      lok sabha elections.and  rahul gandhi is the face of the congress. whether congressmen like it or not  all his words and actions have a bearing on what people think about the party. and that s why his latest foreign jaunt begs the question  is he serious if he is the face of the congress  he can t afford to be seen as a part time politician  especially when pitted against      politicians like narendra modi  who never takes a day off   from politics or governance   and amit shah  who thinks and talks of politics even when he is on a treadmill.gandhi went to mandsaur last year to meet the victims of the police firing on farmers and left for abroad soon after. if there was a congress government in the state  shah would be breathing down its neck until its ouster. gandhi did return to mandsaur a year later  but the momentum was gone. how would people of karnataka think of a leader who kept governance under suspension for days because he didn t have the time to discuss the ministerial portfolio distribution formula with chief minister h.d. kumaraswamy  gandhi had to accompany his mother to the us for a routine medical check up.the president of a     year old party can t be seen changing his ideas and principles every now and then. a big advocate of internal elections to democratise the party until recently  gandhi has chosen to abandon it and exercise his prerogative to nominate the members of the congress working committee  whenever he wishes to. it has been long since one heard him talk about changing the system. and  lalu yadav is his close ally now.gandhi s public utterances have also not helped his image as a serious politician. the president of the congress can t make empty threats to bring an  earthquake  to shake the prime minister. his claim that modi wouldn t be able to stand in front of him if he were to speak for    minutes in parliament didn t serve his cause either.so  it s not his foreign visits that rankle the congressmen. his frequent jaunts out of the country only accentuate the impression of a restless person who doesn t have his heart in his job. for this impression to change  gandhi has to first start taking the job of the congress president seriously.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media

sanju is dishonest to rajkumar hirani s gandhian brand of cinema

kcr cozies up to bjp and naidu to congress  third front takes a back seat
text size  a  a things have come a long way in the last few months since kcr was trying to spearhead a non congress  non bjp front  and naidu was a member of the nda.the powerful leaders of telangana and andhra pradesh seem to have put the idea of a third front or federal front on the backburner.instead  in a volatile political scenario  telangana cm k. chandrasekhar rao seems to be gravitating towards the bharatiya janata party led national democratic alliance  while andhra cm n. chandrababu naidu is cozying up to the congress led united progressive alliance.this is a far cry from a few months ago when kcr  head of the telangana rashtra samithi  was trying to spearhead a non congress  non bjp political alternative  while naidu s telugu desam party was still a member of the nda.kcr sets tongues waggingon    june  kcr called on prime minister narendra modi  leaving political tongues wagging. he didn t even make any attempt to brush them off as just  rumours  started by his detractors. then  on    june  kcr s son and telangana it minister k.t. rama rao also met the pm  who had denied appointments to kerala chief minister pinarayi vijayan and some elected representatives from andhra pradesh.compare this to the april may period  when kcr was postulating ideas and commencing an exercise to agree upon a  national agenda  by meeting prominent regional leaders like west bengal cm mamata banerjee  former tamil nadu cm m. karunanidhi and his son m.k. stalin  h.d. deve gowda and his son kumaraswamy  now chief minister of karnataka   as well as former up cm akhilesh yadav.however  he has played his hand carefully  not shutting the door on the idea of a federal front  obviously for strategic reasons.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowwhen he was in chennai to meet karunanidhi and son  a journalist asked kcr if he was open to working with the congress   his main opposition party in telangana. he displayed dexterity by ruling out the possibility  and even hinting that he wasn t averse to the idea if things moved in that direction.what naidu has been up towhile kcr has left political analysts as well as congress leaders scratching their heads  his former boss naidu has been spitting fire against the bjp and modi since walking out of the nda in march for not acceding to the demand of special category status for andhra pradesh.naidu couldn t conceal his future gameplan when he rubbed shoulders with congress president rahul gandhi in full public glare and in the presence of mamata banerjee  akhilesh yadav and communist leaders sitaram yechury and d. raja at the swearing in ceremony of kumaraswamy in bengaluru. he gave out the clear signal to the other politicians that he would prefer a congress led coalition than a third front.this came as a surprise  for not only is anti congressism the pillar on which the tdp stands  but naidu himself was the architect of the non congress  non bjp united front government of deve gowda and i.k. gujral in the     s  before joining the nda fold in     .considering his experience and manoeuvring skills  some leaders have been looking to naidu as a spearhead of the anti bjp coalition. this naturally irked kcr  but he hadn t yet made many obvious moves in the opposite direction.things came to a head in the midst of the sordid arvind kejriwal versus lieutenant governor episode in new delhi  on the eve of the niti aayog meet. naidu wanted to hog the limelight  but somehow  mamata banerjee emerged as the cynosure  leaving naidu to play second fiddle. this further seems to have pushed naidu into the congress s corner.at around the same time  kcr met the prime minister and also stayed away from rallying behind kejriwal with his other counterparts  signalling his shift towards the bjp.what the future may holdwill kcr s trs join hands with the bjp openly  certainly not. he has a strong political ally in asaduddin owaisi  the mp for hyderabad and supremo of the all india majlis e ittihadul muslimeen  and kcr will never want to rub owaisi the wrong way. however  the man known as the creator of telangana may not be averse to supporting modi if the latter falls short of numbers and seeks a  strategic  post poll alliance.it does seem that both states are preparing for early polls. kcr suggested he was game for an early election  and wouldn t mind simultaneous polls with the lok sabha. he has begun inducting adding some muscle to his party  while also cutting down on some flab.naidu  on the other hand  also seems to be prepared to follow suit  portraying his bete noire y.s. jaganmohan reddy as cohort of the bjp. but he ll also expect to be the glue guy who brings and keeps anti bjp forces together.the author is a senior journalist and columnist based in hyderabad.subscribe to our

nehru wanted jayaprakash narayan as his political successor  not indira gandhi
text size  a  a it is said that jawaharlal nehru wanted his daughter indira gandhi to succeed him as the prime minister. but an examination of the accounts of those who were closely associated with both father and the daughter reveals that it is nothing but just another convenient truth.the congress party in pre independence india was very concerned about succession planning  and often chose young presidents. most presidents of the congress party were in their forties  nehru was    when he first became congress president in        and many like gopal krishna gokhale  subhas chandra bose and maulana abul kalam azad were in their thirties.one of the many reasons why nehru was chosen prime minister over sardar vallabhbhai patel in      was that nehru was    compared to patel who was     and the former was in far better health.after patel s death in       two key questions that would decide the future of politics in india arose  who would be number two in the cabinet  and who would succeed nehru as prime minister also read  why modi is using nehru to try and demolish the gandhi dynasty and congressnehru s first choicenehru was keen on jayaprakash narayan  or jp  born       to succeed him  in view of jp s amazing organisational abilities which were exhibited during the freedom struggle. the intellectual in nehru admired jp s modern education in the us.nehru often remarked that he was not infallible. he was also aware that many of his cabinet colleagues were too scared of him to voice their differences. in fact  nehru had this contempt for many of his cabinet colleagues  they were men of straw who lacked the courage to frankly disagree with him. this had also been observed by mahatma gandhi.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowafter his massive victory in the      lok sabha elections  nehru invited jp to join his government as his deputy  to be his conscience keeper  and to counsel him whenever he felt nehru was wrong. in fact  nehru even proposed a merger between the congress and jp s praja socialist party.but jp rebuffed all of nehru s overtures. jp had this image of himself as being a saint and as a successor to gandhi  far above the lure of office. nehru interpreted this as jp s not wanting to take responsibility for governance and administration  and he felt let down that the man he wanted to groom as his chosen successor was not willing to take on responsibility for running a difficult country.the civil servant who recorded the minutes of meetings between nehru and jp was nehru s relative  ics officer braj kumar nehru.braj kumar nehru s aide memoire of nehru inviting jp to join his cabinet in      says   the prime minister was naturally delighted at his complete victory in the election. what he was unhappy about was the absence of an opposition whom he could respect and who could suggest constructive alternatives. the pm told mr narayan that he was not all knowing  he needed somebody to point out where he was going wrong and to suggest alternatives to achieve agreed goals. his cabinet were all hollow pusillanimous men  whatever their inner qualms were  they did not dare give voice to their misgivings. the prime minister invited mr narayan to form such an opposition within his cabinet    the prime minister asked mr narayan  cajoled him  then begged him  then again tried to persuade him to perform such a role  to lead him back to the right path whenever he was about to stray. but mr narayan s answer was steadfastly  no     mr narayan was totally negative  not positive. he was totally destructive  not constructive. he would criticize  he would agitate  he would even encourage violence  but he would not suggest any positive  constructive way to achieve what he thought required to be done. he did not  in fact  know what should  in positive terms  be done . nehru s offer to jp to join his cabinet and be groomed as his successor  and of jp repeatedly declining  continued through      and     . in jp s praja socialist party  the issue of jp and acharya j.b. kripalani taking up nehru s invitation to join his cabinet was discussed at length. asoka mehta was in favour of it  but kripalani said that the party should provide support to nehru s government from outside and neither jp nor he himself should join nehru s cabinet. however  ram manohar lohia and acharya narendra deva were vehemently opposed to any support for nehru at all.my father  h.y. sharada prasad  who worked with nehru and later became one of the closest advisers and spokesperson for indira gandhi had written then   jp s persistent refusal to assume political authority is a real waste of a vast and unusual national resource .jp is a very baffling philosophical anarchist  ready to fight the aberrations of the state  but reluctant to assume any office of responsibility himself  also read  bumbling nehru  paranoid menon  divided army   stunning tales from india s military historywho encouraged indira h.y. sharada prasad mentions in the book i won t be writing   other essays how govind ballabh pant and uchharangrai navalshankar dhebar exploited jp s reluctance to join the nehru government and rooted for indira gandhi to enter politics  thereby pushing their right wing policies by influencing her. they kept telling her that there was no one else that nehru could rely on  and that it was her duty to assist him because everyone else would let him down  just as jp had.g.b. pant and u.n. dhebar were nearing the end of their lives. politically  they were more conservative and to the right of nehru. they wanted to curb nehru s cozying up to the communists  and thought that they would be able to influence future policies if they got indira gandhi into politics and operated through her as a pliant facade.g.b. pant got indira into various important committees of the congress  and u.n. dhebar  president of the party president for five successive terms from      to       engineered her election as his successor as president of congress in     .nehru himself was quite equivocal about indira gandhi s entry into politics. while he did not explicitly encourage her  he did not dissuade her or her backers. nehru did publicly state that it would not be correct for her to be president of the congress party while he was still the prime minister. but he soon also said that whenever indira was given any responsibility  she performed brilliantly. he also remarked a few times that indira seemed to have a flair for diplomacy and international affairs.nehru wanted to retire in      when he turned   . but he could not decide on a suitable successor. g.b. pant and maulana azad were older than nehru  and in poor health. v.k. krishna menon and morarji desai were detested for their obnoxious personalities  and had too many enemies. gulzari lal nanda and lal bahadur shastri were too mild mannered  without the drive required  and were little known outside india s cow belt. jagjivan ram had allegations of corruption against him  and was not acceptable to large parts of the nation. k. kamaraj nadar and y.b. chavan were regional leaders with no experience at the centre.without nehru s knowledge  g.b pant and indira gandhi ousted the communist government in kerala in      by inciting riots there  and then claimed that the communist government in kerala could not manage the law and order situation. nehru was absolutely livid with indira gandhi.after one year as congress president  indira gandhi declined to be renominated  and withdrew from politics  to concentrate on being nehru s official hostess. even though she functioned as his official hostess in state functions  and ran the prime minister s household  father and daughter barely spoke to each other for several months because of the kerala episode.h.y. sharada prasad stated in a public lecture in vienna in august        more than once she told me that it was govind ballabh pant and u.n. dhebar  and not her father  who had persuaded her to take an active part in the party councils  and that pant also showed her many files. there was one corroborative piece of evidence to support her assertion that she had not foreseen that she might one day be called upon to hold the top spot. and that is  she  who took great care about her father s papers  took none whatever about her own papers   her letters  her speeches  etc. there were no papers with her of her own months as congress president. she was truly torn between remaining a private person and becoming a public personage .also read  morarji desai   the indian prime minister who won pakistan s highest civilian honourthe power struggleafter the death of g.b. pant in march       morarji desai and jagjivan ram engaged in a power struggle to be declared number two in the cabinet. in fact  jagjivan ram even asked indira gandhi and v.k. krishna menon for their support. it was nehru who had to intervene and settle the strife between morarji desai and jagjivan ram because that would have split the congress party.biju patnaik urged nehru to make indira gandhi the minister for external affairs  and anoint her as his successor. but nehru shot down this proposal saying that if he announced a successor  it would doom that person because she he would attract too many enemies.nehru s views about morarji desai too were not very encouraging. he knew that morarji desai succeeding him would be disastrous for the congress party. while morarji was by far the most competent administrator in the cabinet  he was detested for his rigid views  and he did not have the charisma to win elections.in       the american political journalist putnam welles hangen  who had served as the delhi correspondent of national broadcasting corporation since       wrote a book  after nehru  who   in which he listed the names of likely successors  in descending order morarji desai  finance minister indira gandhi lal bahadur shastri  home minister yb chavan  defence minister jaya prakash narayan sk patil  food and agriculture minister general brij mohan kaul  chief of army staff vk krishna menon  who had been dismissed as defence minister after the china war.nehru harshly upbraided indira gandhi for speaking to hangen. an upset indira gandhi told sharada prasad   there is no doubt at all that it is going to be lal bahadur shastri .in early january       after nehru suffered a stroke and was incapacitated  it was shastri who looked after the prime minister s work. this was a clear indication that shastri was to be nehru s successor. biju patnaik and k.d. malaviya lobbied for indira gandhi to be included in the cabinet  but nehru shot down their suggestions.sharada prasad had written   nehru planned his succession very ingeniously through the kamaraj plan. morarji desai  one of the leading claimants  always believed that the kamaraj plan was nehru s plot to do him out of his due. the other leading claimant was lal bahadur shastri. it would have been ideal for the nation if there had been a candidate who combined in himself the best qualities of the two. but that was not to be. shastri and desai were wholly different in temperament and endowments. both were divested of office  along with a few others  under the kamaraj plan  and asked to work for the party. the whole country had a chance to see which of the two would prove more acceptable to the congress rank and file  to whom they would turn for settling their disputes. they turned to the affable  humble shastri rather than to the stern and rather imperiously aloof morarji. also read  the cruel truth is that jayaprakash narayan was let down by his own followerskuldip nayar s versionveteran journalist kuldip nayar  who also served as a press secretary to g.b. pant and lal bahadur shastri believed that nehru always wanted indira gandhi to succeed him as prime minister   even though he may have never enunciated it . nayar in his book on leaders and icons  from jinnah to modi has mentioned his interactions with various leaders to give his version of the theory of succession.nayar recounted an incident to support his claim. shastri had once told nayar that he wanted to go back to allahabad. nayar reminded shastri that he was nehru s chosen successor. to this shastri snapped that nehru s heart was set on his daughter  but added that even so it would not be easy for her to ascend to the prime minister s post.this might have just been a momentary fit of pique on part of shastri.in fact  some of kuldip nayar s commentaries over the decades have been self contradictory. nayar wrote   kamaraj told me that nehru had indicated his preference for shastri as his immediate successor when he appointed him as minister without portfolio after all ministers  including morarji  had resigned under the kamaraj plan .however  nayar also observed that   when kamaraj discussed the matter of succession with nehru   nehru  was deliberately vague. he  nehru  said that the people were the best judge in a democratic polity. yet he mentioned the names of shastri and indira during the discussion as a true and loyal soldier  kamaraj had in mind first shastri and then indira as the prime minister. in the election of both  kamaraj played a key role. morarji was rebuffed every time because kamaraj represented mainline congress opinion and he personally did not want morarji .but  on another occasion  well after shastri s demise  nayar wrote   the truth is that he  shastri  nursed a burning ambition to take over after nehru. all of us who worked with him  shastri  could see that he wanted nothing more than to become india s next prime minister   in another column around the same time  nayar said   he  shastri  exclaimed to me   do you think that i am so much of a saint that i do not want to become prime minister    these assertions of nayar were later objected to by shastri s sons.also read  when lal bahadur shastri sent nehru his resignation   set a gold standard for politiciansshastri s succession theoryregarding the succession  kuldip nayar wrote   shastri did propose two names  jaya prakash narayan and indira gandhi  in that order. based on my interactions with senior leaders of the congress party  shastri had discussed three possibilities about the succession to nehru with his confidantes in the congress party    in shastri s opinion  the most probable scenario was that it would come down to a contest between him and morarji desai  and that he would be able to defeat morarji easily  because morarji was widely disliked. it would be an  anyone but morarji   according to shastri  and he would be the beneficiary.   shastri thought that it would be unlikely that indira gandhi would contest against him because she would be in mourning. but in the event that she did so  it would be a close contest between them  but shastri felt that he still held a slight edge over her  mainly because he had the support of kamaraj.   shastri stated that the best person to lead the nation was jp. he stated that if there was even the slightest indication of interest from jp  he would step aside in favour of jp at once. but shastri felt that it was unlikely that jp would be interested at all.also read  during emergency  jayaprakash narayan was detained in a hospital   could have been poisonedhow moraji failedafter nehru s death on    may       home

patil of bombay  and atulya ghosh of bengal  were dead set against morarji desai.kuldip nayar played a key role in eliminating the chances of morarji desai. in his book  nayar said that morarji s son  kanti desai had told him immediately after nehru s cremation   you can tell shastri that we have the overwhelming support . nayar immediately put out a story in the united news of india that morarji had staked his claim even before nehru s ashes were cold    morarji s son kanti is busy collating lists of possible supporters. in a deeply conservative society like india  this comes across as sacrilegious. in sharp contrast  shastri spent his time and energy supervising nehru s funeral rites. people will never forget that shastri served nehru honestly and loyally  nayar later mentioned about the impact of his report   when my story came out  congress mps were disgusted by what they saw as morarji s crude ambition. at least     hitherto undecided mps switched their support to shastri   nayar added that kamaraj personally thanked him for his role in making shastri prime minister  and that morarji always maintained that nayar had destroyed his chances.shastri s political instincts that neither indira gandhi nor jp would put in a claim were accurate. nayar s article ensured that shastri was the unanimous choice.also read  two yrs before      war  raw s rn kao told indira gandhi

pushed then prime minister lal bahadur shastri to include indira gandhi in his cabinet. when shastri approached her  indira gandhi snapped testily that she was in mourning  and that it was not appropriate for him to ask her at that point  seshan had told h.y. sharada prasad.shastri stated that he would have to include one member of the nehru family in his cabinet. if indira would not accept  then he would offer the post to nehru s sister  vijayalakshmi pandit. indira gandhi and her aunt were at loggerheads since her early childhood  and indira knew that if her aunt was in the cabinet  her life would be made miserable. it is not clear to me from n.k. seshan s statements whether shastri saying that he would invite vijayalakshmi pandit was a bluff to get indira to join his cabinet  or whether he genuinely intended to have pandit in his cabinet if indira refused.indira gandhi accepted shastri s offer of a cabinet post. shastri assigned her the middle level portfolio of information

minister gulzari lal nanda was again sworn in as interim prime minister. morarji desai moved quickly to publicly declare his candidature. the lure of office bit even a self abnegating person like nanda. according to n.k. seshan  nanda approached indira gandhi  and tactfully inquired if she was a candidate. indira was evasive. nanda then hinted that he would be grateful for indira s support to continue in office till the      elections. indira cautiously replied that she would go along with whatever the party decided. nanda misinterpreted this as her support  and he went to kamaraj  and asserted that he should be allowed to continue as prime minister until the      elections  seshan had told h.y. sharada prasad.but kamaraj had already set his mind on indira gandhi as the person who had the charisma to defeat morarji. the other four members of the syndicate wanted kamaraj himself to take over as prime minister. but kamaraj made his now famous statement   no english  no hindi. how    and set about gathering support for indira.kamaraj asserted   she knows all the world leaders  has travelled widely with her father  has grown up amongst the great men of the freedom movement  has a rational and modern mind  is totally free of any parochialism   state  caste or religion. she has possibly inherited her father s scientific temper and  above all  in      she can win the election .morarji s remarks  that chit of a girl  further alienated those who held nehru s memory sacred  and indira easily defeated morarji by     votes to      to become prime minister.also read  shankar

world statesmen at close quarters. but she was not privy to cabinet papers or government files  and did not receive intelligence or military briefings. during my discussions with him  kuldip nayar was not able to provide me any concrete evidence of nehru actively promoting his daughter. former finance minister t.t. krishnamachari had told my father h.y. sharada prasad that the maximum all nehru hoped for indira was that she would be minister of state for external affairs in shastri s council of ministers.if jp had accepted nehru s pleas to join his cabinet and succeed him as prime minister  the history of india would have been very different.the only person who probably captured the succession story right was cartoonist k. shankar pillai. his cartoon published in shankar s weekly depicted a marathon race  with the winners being lal bahadur shastri         followed by indira gandhi        and morarji desai         with all the other candidates collapsing on the race track.ravi

jobless workers  crisis can be congress  suit boot ki sarkar moment. it can embarrass modi
text size  a  a the ongoing workers  crisis has the potential to become the congress   suit boot ki sarkar  moment. it has been five years since the congress last managed to corner the narendra modi led bjp government at the centre on any issue  displayed its effectiveness as an opposition party  and actually managed to score a political point.in       congress leader rahul gandhi had forced prime minister modi to go back on his plans to dilute the land acquisition act with his  suit boot ki sarkar  jibe  and perhaps helped put his government on the path of jan kalyan  public welfare  with a pro rural emphasis.five years later  the uncomfortable reality of the jobless labourers witnessed during the pandemic induced lockdown   the image of lakhs of people  including children  walking hundreds of kilometres in scorching heat  barefoot and hungry  to reach their villages   has exposed the modi government s failure to tackle a crisis. if the congress is able to handle the situation smartly and astutely  it could be the second big issue on which it can corner modi and also try to emerge out of political wilderness.the congress has traditionally held a strong grip over rural india  which was its strength for long  but has been gradually eaten away by the bharatiya janata party  bjp  of modi and home minister amit shah. but it s not all over for the congress. even today  the party shows glimpses of being able to understand  and potentially tap into  the rural pulse. the workers  crisis offers it an opportunity to do just that  especially given how ill prepared and thoughtless modi and his team have come out looking since the lockdown was first announced on    march.also read  by sealing delhi ncr borders  covid has ended fluidity between where labourers live and workthe lost yearsever since it was trounced in the      lok sabha election  the congress has slipped deeper into a rut of irrelevance.everything it tried  failed. sustained attacks against demonetisation  questioning the clumsy roll out of the goods and services tax  gst   trying to corner the government on the the issue of a dwindling economy and job losses  and most significantly  rahul gandhi s shrill rafale tirade   all gave zero results to the congress. not just electorally  these efforts failed politically too  leaving no impact   symbolically or otherwise   that could make one say the government had been embarrassed before the indian public.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowon the contrary  a lot of the congress  attacks boomeranged  because it took the wrong path of targeting modi personally  such as the  chaiwala  jibe   and on the issue of corruption  it did so without realising the extent of the pm s popularity and the voters  belief in his  integrity .the  chowkidar chor hai  slogan coined  and repeated ad nauseam  by rahul gandhi was political harakiri. the voters didn t see the pm as corrupt  and took it as an entitled dynast trying to sully their leader s image. the congress needed to attack modi s governance  not modi himself. and for that  it needed to touch the most vulnerable nerve   the modi government s inability to deliver on the promises made to the poor and the rural base. this is a new  unsteady constituency for the bjp   traditionally an upper caste  middle class  brahmin baniya party. it still has the potential to make modi nervous  and amit shah worried about his electoral math going haywire.also read  this      law could have given migrants safety net for lockdown  but was never implementedthe right nervedespite being down and out after its lacklustre performance in the      election  the one thing that the congress managed to do just right was hit the modi government where it hurt most   the  anti poor  image.rahul gandhi s supposed takedown of modi s monogrammed suit worth lakhs of rupees and buttoning it with a  pro rich  pro corporate  image was bang on. it unsettled an otherwise confident modi  and people have repeatedly heard him harp on welfare  poor and rural policies since then  all the way up to the      lok sabha election.now  the situation of migrant workers  amplified due to their shabby treatment by the modi government  has offered the congress a similar opening. its president sonia gandhi has held meetings with leaders of other opposition parties on the issue  while both rahul and priyanka gandhi have maintained the pressure on the government.also read  covid lockdown has ended only opposition politics in india. bjp s shop is very much opencongress  chancemake no mistake  the modi government knows how this episode has the potential to snowball into a bigger one  damaging an image it has so carefully crafted for itself since the       suit boot  fiasco. the congress does well when it taps into the vulnerabilities of the bjp   the anti incumbency and farmers  anger in madhya pradesh  an unpopular leadership in rajasthan  a corrupt government led by raman singh in chhattisgarh  a less than effective leader in manohar lal khattar in haryana  and so on.for better or worse  the congress has been decidedly left of centre  especially under sonia and rahul gandhi. this is precisely why the moment modi seems insensitive towards the poor or the rural voter  the congress gets the opportunity to showcase its bleeding heart.as the images of hapless migrants scrambling to get back to their homes continue to spread far and wide  making sure modi and his government are haunted by them until the crisis ends  the congress needs to play its cards right  and step up its attack on the bjp s inability to take care of the poor. most importantly  the party must allow both its national and state leaderships to lead this battle from the front. if done right  this could be the beginning of a new dawn for the congress.views are personal.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis   only you can fix it you are reading this

is director mira nair s regal  long shelves chock full of what could only be some amazing books.but then there are also the likes of actor alia bhatt s rather sad one shelf with only a few books. also disappointing was the row of books behind congress leader rahul gandhi during one of his virtual press conferences. we expected better from him.and speaking of sad  uk conservative mp dominic raab takes the cake. for an interview  raab chose nine  thick  hardcover political books to flank him. this included biographies of former us president richard nixon and actor arnold schwarzenegger.but

audio  unpredictable network and pixelated videos. so  now instead of micro gestures one has to rely on visual cues  and books are pretty much within the smart domain.if your face does get stuck in an unfortunate expression  you d rather have your colleague  boss or contact stare at the lovely collection of books behind you.as amanda hess writes in the new york times   there is a hint of tender vulnerability embedded in these authoritative displays. at a time when even our appointed experts rarely know what s really going on  the veneer of respectability is always at risk of tumbling down.  at least as much respectability and authority you can muster with dead tree produced books in the background.also read  dear book snobs  your day of reckoning is here. and it took a pandemicon credibility  shelf envy   judgementeven though bookshelves  to a great extent  are intended to help people act supercilious  one cannot deny the voyeuristic pleasure derived by peeping into personal libraries. also  one cannot deny that books in general make everything better and more appealing. a case in point is the very popular instagram page  hot guys reading nyc  that posts photographs of men reading books  and just the number of likes and comments each post garners is enough to conclude that men who read are very attractive.these quarantine bookshelves have a similar sort of appeal. as gal beckerman  editor at the new york times  books  writes   bibliophiles do not approach bookshelves lightly. a stranger s collection is to us a window to their soul. we peruse with judgment  sometimes admiration and occasionally repulsion. this judgment has also become very popular twitter content. the account  bookcase credibility   with over        followers  gives detailed  sardonic and sometimes philosophical views on what famous people s bookshelves say about them. from author arundhati roy s  book cairns  to british computer scientist alan woodward s bookcase that is rightly described as  a masterpiece of perspective    bookcase credibility is the two minutes of fame that every individual library vies for.it looks like arundhati roy lives with a book loving poltergeist and is in for a surprise when she turns round but no  she has built book cairns. they are burial sites or signposts  human understanding has reached an end or there is a path ahead. which is it  arundhati knows. pic.twitter.com kn  rvql d   bookcase credibility   bcredibility  may         but it is not all sunshine and rainbows  you can be on this account s radar for all the wrong reasons too. for instance  former uk prime minister gordon brown was called out for his  kitchen sink approach  and multiple copies of the same book  the horror  the horror .gordon brown. a standard bookcase

were spared by this twitter account because their library  while aesthetically pleasing  is mostly full of coffee table books. and no  books with big pictures that are meant to be flipped cannot be at par with novels and non fiction. sorry.but there is one person in bollywood that we know owns a great library   shah rukh khan. khan has given glimpses of his impressive library earlier and we also know for a fact that he once pulled an all nighter to rearrange his library  swoon  . this is one of the comments  by no doubt another spy like us  under a youtube podcast with khan   someone else noticed the book on the table   its  muhammad s.a.w  by martin lings . srk has a good collection of books   an instagram live in the mannat library is long overdue.bookshelves are now all the rage and

modi draws the worst  dumps the best of nehru   indira gandhi   and this might win him     
text size  a  a modi is deeply statist  just like indira and nehru. he believes nothing is wrong with the government  if you know how to run it  like him.unrelated coincidences have brought two past titans of indian politics back in the debate  indira gandhi  because of the emergency anniversary  and jawahar lal nehru  after former congress minister saifuddin soz s claim that he saved kashmir for india while sardar vallabhbhai patel was  adamant  on letting it go to pakistan.both have also come under fresh criticism from the bjp. indira gandhi more than her father. because narendra modi has made emergency the centre piece of his counter attack on the congress  your grandmother imposed the emergency  and you have the cheek to call me a dictator after nehru and indira  modi is our first all powerful national leader. we aren t counting rajiv gandhi and vajpayee here. one lost his sway too soon into his tenure  the other  although much loved and respected  didn t have real power  within his own party. modi is no vajpayee. no two public figures could be so different  but let s leave that discussion for another day.four years into his tenure now  it is evident that modi is more indira than nehru. there is  however  a bit of both in him. that is why he continues winning elections like them. he has drawn from both  but not necessarily the best of their qualities. he might have even picked some of their worst.modi does not look like he is about to lose     . there is a lot of unhappiness against his government. but his personal popularity is by and large intact. globally  you call politicians teflon coated if scams  criticism  even blunders do not stick on them. modi  i prefer to describe as cast in titanium instead. that hasn t changed. a repeat of     in      might look distant at this point  but once he goes seeking votes for himself  it will take something extraordinary to defeat him. just like indira and nehru  at re election time  he is making it a one horse race.he has drawn much from their playbooks to protect his personal popularity  like them   but has that been the best thing for india we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nownehru s best attributes were his personal liberalism  respect for institutions  intellect and curiosity. he was a voracious reader and interacted globally with men and women of minds better than his. he was tolerant of disagreement although not necessarily in his own party  deeply respectful of parliament and media freedoms. he also had a sense of ideology and morality  as he saw it  in his foreign relations. as a result  he built institutions  had india punching above its weight until      and restored social cohesion after the killings of     .nehru s biggest negative was his woolly headed left of centre view of the economy  an exaggerated notion of his own moral authority at home and in the world  obsession with global summiteering and smiling at cameras with fellow heads of state. he showed surprising inability to differentiate india s strategic interests from optics. he was chasing the utopia of panchsheel while the chinese were grabbing indian territory  no salami slicing as is the norm now but gulping down big chunks like diwali ki mithai.indira gandhi s best qualities were her deeply secular instinct  ability to redefine indian foreign policy  predominantly in terms of its immediate strategic interest in the neighbourhood. she inherited nehru s scientific temper and fully supported the green revolution. which  you wonder  if it could have been possible in these paranoid times when dr manmohan singh s congress upa government shunned the latest breakthrough   genetically modified seeds that are to global farming what hybrids were    years ago.on national defence  she was a big picture leader. that s why she waited until she was ready to win decisively in      instead of rushing in and making day to day tactical issues with pakistan central to her domestic political rhetoric. she wasn t open to criticism but was never talent averse. that s why she built a stellar team of advisors  until most fell out because of the emergency.on the flip side  she was dictatorial and driven by power. she finished most of the political talent  older and young within her party. k. kamraj to d.k. barooah as party president underlines this.she was cavalier in her approach to institutions  unleashed awful economic populism  took top income tax to    per cent and turned nehru s already gooey idea of mixed economy into a pucca licence quota raj  nationalising large sectors  from finance to coal to petroleum  raised tax rates and played with the agricultural economy  and burnt her fingers . she also left an unhappy  insecure and resentful neighbourhood.take a close look at modi s four years now. check where he looks like nehru or indira and where he doesn t. he certainly looks as personally popular as both at this point in his tenure. he has great global presence and first name acquaintance with many world leaders. his personal integrity is beyond reproach. in a broader sense  he has the same magisterial sway over pan national public opinion as the other two. he has given india a new confidence  indians have a renewed swagger.at the same time  his economics is more socialist than nehru s  almost as populist as indira s. he hasn t nationalised any sector  failing with even air india  but he is re nationalising much  in a manner of speaking. he is simply getting one public sector company to acquire another  thereby using these as his off balance sheet milch cows. if the economic statistics do not look good  he isn t disinclined to have them dressed up. like both indira and nehru  he is deeply statist. he believes nothing is wrong with the government  if you know how to run it  like him. the government  therefore  is becoming bigger  more intrusive.his chief ministers are hand picked nobodies  the party is fully dependent on him for votes. his obsession with summiteering rivals nehru s but his approach to foreign relations is transactional. it hasn t worked. our big power ties are wobbly. our neighbourhood is stressed again and we are left with just one friend  bangladesh.further  if upa bowed to a left luddite gallery on gm seeds  he is surrendering to the loony  xenophobic swadeshis of the right. we aren t sure he reads very much or has time for people with intellect and fame in their specific fields. his government is the most talent averse in our history yet  even having got rid of the few good  professional economists it had. most problematic  our political discourse has degenerated into non stop abuse and accordingly  the social cohesion is stressed.draw a line at the bottom of this balance sheet  add and subtract  assign what weightage you wish to each factor. i leave it to you then to decide whether modi has drawn the best  or the worst attributes of nehru and indira. i must qualify again  the best qualities in a leader do not necessarily win you a re election. check out the fate of vajpayee      .subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis   only you can fix it

sanjay gandhi zinda hai  the emergency temptation is alive in congress and bjp alike
text size  a  a sanjay gandhi s excesses showed the problem with dynastic politics. with maneka and varun in its fold  the bjp cannot complain about it.there hasn t been a greater villain in the politics of independent india than sanjay gandhi. without holding any office  he was an extra constitutional authority whose word was the law of the land.sanjay gandhi is so discredited for his alleged excesses during the emergency that you d think no politician or party would want to be associated with him  let alone his own congress party.yet the congress party claimed his legacy on his death anniversary.we fondly remember sanjay gandhi  visionary leader and an advocate of the poor. he championed the need for affordable cars in india. pic.twitter.com y tpx  gh    congress   incindia  june         there s nothing the congress party can t forgive the nehru gandhi bloodstream for  not even the obscene dictatorship of a    year old who manipulated his mother and ruled india like a dictator.many leaders of the bjp and the rss resisted the emergency and went to jail for it. but today  sanjay gandhi is not a bad name in the party. just before the      lok sabha elections  his widow maneka gandhi joined the bjp and so did his son varun gandhi  who has variously been known as feroze varun gandhi and varun sanjay gandhi.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowthe bjp is observing emergency s   rd anniversary today as a black day. maneka and varun gandhi will be conveniently absent from the photo ops.sanjay gandhi died in a plane crash because he thought he d live forever and didn t need to follow the safety precautions. but the spirit of the emergency lives on in indian politics. .contempt for democracy  civil liberties were curtailed  fundamental rights were suspended  the press was subjected to pre publication censorship  and opposition leaders were put in jail.this temptation to misuse the might of the state to silence political opposition and the media still exists in indian politics. political opponents are not blatantly jailed for political reasons  but they face corruption and other inquiries unless they belong to the ruling party.faced with rising online criticism  the upa   government had enacted internet censorship laws under which it was putting cartoonists in jail. similarly  there are many who are getting arrested for criticising prime minister narendra modi.the media is always under pressure to toe the government line. journalist barkha dutt recently claimed she s almost been threatened by the government to not work on a new tv channel. licenses are not being given for freshnews channels  except for those who are allegedly going to act as government propaganda. in her brief stint as i b minister  smriti irani tried to tame the media in her own way. . dynastic politics  when indira gandhi lost the post emergency election in       rajiv gandhi said  i will never forgive sanjay  gandhi  for having brought mummy to this position . rajiv gandhi entered politics because  mummy  needed him. maneka and varun gandhi were inducted into the bjp to embarrass the congress.sanjay gandhi s alleged excesses showed what the problem with dynastic politics is. when the dynast thinks he owns the country because his mummy is the prime minister  that s when there s a problem with dynasty. that sense of entitlement can endanger democracy. but dynastic politics continues in all parties  from kashmir to kanyakumari. with mother son maneka and varun in its fold  the bjp can hardly complain about it. . quick fix solutions  sanjay gandhi was so proud of his sterilisation drive that he thought he d be remembered for it   in a good way. targets were set for the bureaucracy  and strict penalties were prescribed for not meeting them. millions of men were sterilised against their wishes  especially muslims and the poor. similarly  slums were bulldozed overnight and people were forcibly relocated. these quick fix solutions  it was later evident  actually caused more problems. family planning efforts actually suffered a setback for a while.indian politics still has that temptation for quick fix solutions which impede democracy. one big example of this was the november      demonetisation of high denomination indian currency. people couldn t withdraw their own money for weeks  there were those who committed suicide because of cash crunch  the economy slowed down for several quarters  and no black money was destroyed. . crony capitalism  the congress party is hailing sanjay gandhi for championing affordable cars  and varun gandhi is defending his late father on the same count.the congress and the bjp seem to be on the same page then  white washing the scam that was the maruti project.sanjay gandhi went abroad to do an internship with rolls royce because he loved cars. he didn t even complete the internship  returned to india in      and started setting up maruti as a private company. all rules were broken to make maruti possible but the car couldn t become a reality. there were allegations of corruption and nepotism  land grab and cronyism  but maruti didn t take off in his lifetime. it wasn t sanjay gandhi but japan s suzuki which made maruti possible  only after his death.a politician s son getting undue favours  gaming the system  and making money doesn t shock us. it is normal. robert vadra and jay shah are only among the more prominent political names to have faced such allegations. across india  political sons seem to be great entrepreneurs by birth. . manipulation of the judiciary  in its greatest moment of shame  the supreme court of india legitimised the emergency. with the government and the judiciary at loggerheads  the independence of the judiciary remains a concern. with four supreme court judges  one of them retired last week  doing a press conference against the chief justice earlier this year  we were reminded that institutions are only as good as the people who lead them. a strong executive always desires a pliant judiciary.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis   only you can fix it you

those opposed to indira gandhi were a special target of emergency   so was i
text size  a  a  the rule of law was sought to be replaced by a politically dangerous principle that indira gandhi was indispensable. a situation was created for the party to rally behind her. the years      and      were high points in the political career of smt. indira gandhi. she challenged the senior leaders of her own party and a grand alliance of opposition party. she won convincingly the      general elections. she was the key centre of political power for the next five years. there was no challenge to her within her own party. the year      also witnessed a civil revolt in east pakistan where in a general election the awami league led by sheikh mujibur rahman had won a clear majority in the pakistan parliament. zulfikar ali bhutto s party had lesser number of seats than the awami league. how could pakistan allow its government to be dominated by east pakistan  it refused to accept the mandate leading to revolt in east pakistan. it snowballed into a major crisis with the mukti bahini battling the pakistani army. ultimately a war with india started on  rd december      . by   th december the indian forces had taken control of east pakistan and made substantial headway in west pakistan. the pakistani forces in east pakistan surrendered to india and were taken as prisoners of war. for india and mrs. indira gandhi the break up of pakistan was a major political development which led to the creation of a new nation   bangladesh.mismanagement of the economy  slogans vs policythe stage was now set for mrs. indira gandhi to rule india  deliver to it the promise of  garibi hatao  and bring substantial economic growth in india. at this point her popularity was very high. during the decades   s and   s  the average growth rate of gdp had only been  .  . most countries in the world were now trying to get out of a regulated economy which was proving to be counter productive. even communist nations were either on the brink of break up or rejecting state regulation. by keeping one party rule intact  china decided to move ahead with the liberalized economy. the tragedy of mrs. indira gandhi politics was she preferred the popular slogans over sound and sustainable policies. the government with a huge electoral mandate at the centre and the states  continued in the same economic directions which she had experimented in the late      s. she believed that india s slow growth was on account of smuggling and economic offences. she enacted a preventive detention law cofeposa to deal with smuggling. she believed that confiscation of smugglers  assets could bring to india a large resource and hence safema was enacted. she believed that large enterprises with economies of scale had to be stopped and mrtp act was made more stringent. she believed that land regulations in terms of size  ownership must also apply to urban areas and hence the urban land ceiling law was enacted. this led to residential construction and apartments  development not taking off as large chunks of urban land got frozen. only state development authorities were allowed to develop land. she believed that outsourcing of business was harmful and the contract labour abolition act was brought in. she nationalized insurance and coal mine business. she botched up the nationalization of wheat trade  subsequently reversed  to tackle the unmanageable inflation. it led to greater inflation. this led to social and trade union unrest where large number of man days were lost. the first oil shock had already had an adverse impact. due to its tilt towards pakistan  the united states suspended a lot of aid to india. inflation in      touched a staggering   .  percent and reached   .  percent in     . labour laws were made more stringent and these led to a near economic collapse. there was large scale unemployment and the unprecedented price rise. investment in the economy had taken a back seat. to make matters worse fera was enacted. the foreign exchange resources in      and      were a mere  .  billion dollars.on   th february      shri y.b. chavan  the finance minister presented the budget in which he said  as the house is aware the government has been deeply concerned about the acute inflationary pressure that has prevailed in the economy during the last two years  it is a matter of deep regret that despite these measures  prices continue to rise  the steep fall of  .   in agricultural output in         was bound to upset the balance in demand and supply  the available indications suggest that there was hardly any increase in the rate of growth of industrial production in      .in the budget speech of          finance minister c. subramaniam echoed similar words  inflation has been spreading and its devastating impact across national boundaries continue to impose on developing countries such as india burdens and hardships which we have been ill equipped to withstand. the impact on the living standard of our people and on the pattern of real incomes within the country has been serious enough .the loss of political goodwillby      it became apparent that the government had no intention of changing a disastrous economy path on which it had embarked. its political strategy was instrumental in the government losing the sympathy of the intelligentsia. it was engaged in a battle with the supreme court in order to ensure that the golak nath judgement was reversed. this effort failed as majority of judges decided against the government in the keshvanand bharti case. the three senior judges of the supreme court justice shelat  justice grover and justice hegde were superseded and justice a.n. ray was appointed chief justice of india. the superseded judges resigned. the court was now packed with government preferred judges. a dangerous thesis was propagated by law minister h.r. gokhale and steel and mines minister mohan kumaramangalam that judiciary must follow the social philosophy of the government and judges must be appointed on the basis of their social philosophy.the press was not spared either. one way of controlling the media was to pinch the pocket of the media. the government therefore  passed an order putting restrictions on the number of advertisements that a newspaper could carry. it was challenged before the supreme court by the leading newspapers. fortunately  the constitution bench by majority of four against one struck down the government action. justice k.k. mathew a pro government judge in the keshavanand bharti case was the dissenting judge who favoured media restrictions.we

college in ahmedabad were increased. the second event related to the maverick socialist leader raj narain who had lost the      elections to smt. indira gandhi and had filed an election petition challenging the validity of her election before the allahabad high court. political observers had initially believed these events as one of the little consequences to the government and mrs. gandhi.the low key agitation arising from the hostel price rise engulfed the whole city of gujarat and it became impossible for the chief minister chimanbhai patel to manage the social unrest. it became an unmanageable mass movement. the entire civil society was on the streets. the students of gujarat led the movement. the veteran leader morarji desai sat on a fast unto death  till assembly was dissolved and fresh elections were held. the government had to give in  leading to the dissolution of the state assembly and holding of the fresh elections in june     .developments in gujarat triggered similar sentiments in other parts of the country. the immediate impact was in bihar where frustrated with corruption  unemployment and inflation  the chhatra sangharsh samiti launched a mass movement in the state. shri j.p. narayan  jp  who had retired from active public life  jumped into the movement. he inspired the students not only in bihar but all over the country to organize similar protests. in      as a president of the delhi university students  union  i convened student leaders from all over the country for a two day coordination committee meeting with jp. i requested jp to address a mass rally on the university campus in delhi which witnessed an unprecedented turn out. jp toured several parts of india. student organizations and political parties  particularly the jan sangh  congress  o  swatantra party  the socialists all joined the movement. gandhian and sarvodaya leaders became active in the movement. the akali dal got out from the gurudwara politics. led by sardar prakash singh badal  it joined jp in a big way. so did the veterans biju patnaik and acharya kriplani.  th june      turned out to be one of the most disappointing days for mrs. indira gandhi. she had been unable to manage the economy. she was increasingly seen as dictatorial and vindictive. the opposition had joined ranks against her. the day began with the sad news of the demise of one of closest advisers shri d.p. dhar. by the afternoon the result of gujarat assembly election had come and the congress party lost gujarat for the first time and shri morarji desai s blessed opposition alliance led by shri babubhai desai won an absolute majority. then came the stunning news that justice jag mohan lal sinha of the allahabad high court had unseated mrs. indira gandhi as a member of parliament and declared her election as null and void. she was accused of spending more money on the elections than permissible and having secured services of yashpal kapoor  a public servant  to further her election process. she was held guilty of corrupt practices.are individuals indispensable in a democracy by the evening of   th june large demonstrations were organized outside the prime minister s residence that the judgement of allahabad high court should not be accepted. the rule of law was sought to be replaced by a politically dangerous principle that indira gandhi was indispensable. a situation was created for the party to rally behind her. an appeal to the supreme court was immediately prepared and filed. she succeeded in getting nani palkhivala to appear for her. it was the month of june and the vacation judge justice v.r. krishna iyer was to hear this appeal and the possible grant of interim order against the high court judgement. before the hearing  the law minister gokhale wanted to meet justice krishna iyer and discuss the case with him. the judge asked gokhale the purpose of the meeting which gokhale told him honestly. the judge politely declined the meeting. this was disclosed by the judge in his memoirs. the judge heard palkhivala for indira gandhi and shanti bhushan for raj narain and passed the usual order which is passed in election appeals. the appeal was admitted. palkhivala s request for a stay on the judgement of the allahabad high court was rejected. indira gandhi could attend parliament but could not speak as a member of parliament. she could speak only as the prime minister. the supreme court s order intensified the demand for her resignation. on   th june the opposition leader met at the gandhi peace foundation with jp. as the convener of youth and student organizations  i sat in the back row observing the then national leaders chalking out the strategy. a nationwide satyagrah was to be launched from the   th of the june. the   th june witnessed a big rally at ramlila maidan. the pressure for resignation was building up.the midnight of   th junesince the war with pakistan in      india was already in a declared stage of emergency under article     of the constitution. this emergency was on account of external aggression. there was no need to declare a second emergency. but it was siddhartha shankar ray who advised her that the second proclamation of emergency was required. it was necessary  he argued to proclaim emergency on account of internal disturbances. accordingly on the mid night of   th and   th june a fresh proclamation was got signed by the president on a state of internal emergency. simultaneously with the proclamation under article     another proclamation under article     was issued suspending the fundamental rights under articles            and    of the constitution. every indian was now devoid of this fundamental right. it was a phoney emergency on account of proclaimed policy that indira gandhi was indispensable to india and all contrarian voices had to be crushed. the constitutional provisions were used to turn democracy into a constitutional dictatorship.the morning of   th junein the midnight of   th and   th june political leaders across the country were arrested by the police. all those who were opposed to mrs. indira gandhi were a special target. i was one of those whose house was encircled by the police in the early hours of   th morning. my father  a lawyer  asked for the documents for my detention  which the police did not have. they took him to the police station and then sent him back saying that i must report to the police. in the meanwhile  i escaped from my house and spent the night with a friend in the neighborhood. on coming to know what was happening i started to prepare for organizing a protest on the morning of   th june. in the early morning i was trying to find out what was happening in other parts of the country. most of the leaders had been arrested and were taken to jail. the electricity connection at bahadurshah zafar marg   delhi s press street  was cut off to ensure that no newspapers were published. by    am censorship has been imposed on the newspapers and an official of the censor was sitting in the office of every newspaper. i led a protest of delhi university students where we burnt effigy of the emergency and i delivered a speech against what was happening. the police had arrived in large number. i got arrested only to be served a detention order under the maintenance of internal security act. i was taken to delhi s tihar jail for the purpose of detention. i thus got the privilege for organizing the only protest on the morning of   th june      and became the first satyagrahi against the emergency. little did i realize that at a young age of    years  i was participating in events which were going to be a part of history. for me this event changed the future course of my life. by late afternoon  i was

aadhaar  mgnrega  dbt  rural housing   how modi has hijacked congress legacy
text size  a  a prime minister narendra modi has slowly  but with sharp focus and political craftiness  appropriated much of the congress led governments  welfare legacy.from aadhaar to the direct benefit transfer scheme  and from mgnregs to rural housing   the modi government has made several of the congress  marquee initiatives its own  helping the bharatiya janata party  bjp  project itself as the great saviour of rural india  as against its predominantly brahmin baniya image earlier.with finance minister nirmala sitharaman s latest rural booster shot through an additional rs        crore under the mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee act  mgnrega    a rural job programme conceptualised and introduced by the upa   government   modi s dispensation has underscored its commitment to the scheme and to use it to the hilt at the time of an unprecedented crisis.a hold over rural india was the strength of the congress as a national party  which has gradually eroded with it ceding space to the earlier more urban centric bjp. but more significant than the electoral and political implications of this is the symbolism of it all   modi using congress  initiatives to lay the ground of his pro welfare image.and how has this been possible  simply because somewhere down the line  the congress was foolish enough to abandon its own creations  or not market them as a substantive legacy. modi  on the other hand  has been clever enough to know the importance of slyly using his rival s initiatives and then  going on to make them seem like his babies.also read  india has social schemes for poor in crises like covid. but it needs a  who to pay  databasehow modi has taken all that was congress since coming to power in       narendra modi has  with great precision  adopted several of his predecessors  innovations  which in turn  have helped his welfare governance model.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowrefresh to      when he had just assumed power. modi dragged aadhaar out from the dusty storeroom it had been relegated to  held several high level meetings and made it clear that this unique identification number has to be promoted. it wasn t the upa  which had brought in aadhaar under nandan nilekani s leadership and vision  that gave it the legal backing it needed. it was the modi government that stood by the scheme  brought in an act to back it and fought the long and polarised legal battle to defend it.aadhaar   a upa child   has for all practical purposes become modi s forever now.the direct benefit transfer or dbt scheme  again launched by the congress with much pomp and show in       and which along with aadhaar strengthens the delivery of government welfare schemes   has also been used extensively by modi to dole out pro poor policies  including recently when his government said it would use this cash transfer mechanism to help the poor amid the coronavirus pandemic.also read  focus on rural india  women  sc sts   budget      fits into modi govt s welfare plankthe rural housing scheme   indira awaas yojana   was replete with lacunae in implementation. modi realised the importance of the scheme  changed its name  made it all about himself in       but also brought in changes that helped make it far more effective and popular.  modiji ne ghar diya hai  modi has given us a home    was a common refrain before the      lok sabha election  and went on to help the prime minister massively in his re election bid.now  with this whopping allocation to mgnregs  modi has made this scheme very much his own  ironically after having called it a  living monument of the upa s failures  in parliament in     .the findings of the socio economic caste census  secc    started by the upa in        finally came out in      and since  has formed the bedrock of this government s welfare policies in terms of identifying and targeting beneficiaries.essentially  modi realised early on in his tenure that the  suit boot ki sarkar  image could be his undoing  and soon enough  turned towards  jan kalyan . he didn t have to do much  the congress had kept most of the ingredients ready for him. all he did was mix them together as per his own recipe  add the modi tadka and sell them as his own. of course  not to take away from the fact that he did realise the significance of these schemes and was willing to invest in them.also read  pm modi s  st year report card   c in economy  d in governance  but a in political opticscongress   master of abandonmentmore than modi s shrewdness  it is the lack of vision of the congress party that is reflected in how its legacy is fast eroding.the rural housing scheme was named after indira gandhi  but the congress did not bother to invest any more in it than the routine bureaucratic interest.mgnrega was widely credited with the upa s improved performance at the hustings in the      lok sabha election  but eventually  somewhere down the line  the party lost interest in improving or promoting it  despite sonia gandhi s backing of it. then rural development minister jairam ramesh and finance minister p. chidambaram got into a spat over what the former saw as  savage cuts  in rural schemes. the result   it seemed the upa did not care much about welfare and the party was divided on the issue.dbt was picked by the congress and forgotten in no time. but most brutal was its treatment of aadhaar. the unique identification system was brought in with much fanfare  but dropped like a hot potato early on in its journey. intra party rivalries  differences within the government and no coherent strategy meant no one was on the same page  and policies  schemes and innovations suffered.the congress  loss has been modi s gain  at least in terms of optics. very little is left of the upa years that the voter would remember it by. modi has ensured he has put his stamp on everything that was never his and that his party once vociferously criticised. the congress  meanwhile  has gifted away to the bjp what it should have proudly owned forever.views are personal.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis   only you can fix it you are reading this

in bhopal accusing her two sons ajay and abhimanyu of domestic abuse.the allegations immediately cast a political shadow because son ajay singh is the leader of opposition in madhya pradesh assembly.on his part  ajay singh blames his sister veena of  playing politics  and acting at the behest of the ruling bjp in madhya pradesh. ajay claims the timing of his mother s petition is politically motivated because he is in the process of filing a no confidence motion against shivraj singh chouhan government in madhya pradesh assembly during the monsoon session  set to begin from    june. the state assembly polls are due in november     .of course  both the state unit of the bjp and chief minister chouhan are taking a keen interest in the family feud.chouhan told local reporters that he had even offered some advice to ajay singh that went like this   there is no bigger asset than a mother in this world. mother is like god. she  saroj singh  is the wife of late arjun singh  a

accused ajay singh of failing in his duties as a son.in her petition  saroj singh has sought relief from the court alleging that she is not allowed to stay at  kerwa kothi  in the outskirts of bhopal. she said her sons were not letting her enter the house. my sons abhimanyu singh and lop ajay singh indulged in domestic violence against me and forced me out of my own house. they have also refused to take care of my maintenance which compelled me to approach the court   the mother wrote in her complaint.saroj singh or  rani sahiba  is not a weak  ailing woman. she is a legendary figure in madhya pradesh  who is credited to have played a key role in her husband s political career as he served as the state chief minister thrice  a governor  a union minister and an aicc vice president.the court has listed saroj singh s petition for hearing on july   .kerwa kothi  overlooking a picturesque dam and also known as  devshri   has had its own share of controversies. a high court judge in      had

as a rebel from the family turf sidhi while ajay had campaigned hard for the official congress nominee there. both candidates lost  and the congress party blamed arjun singh for his failure to prevent his daughter from contesting. it was  many believe  one of the reasons why arjun singh was not made a minister when upa  under manmohan singh  had returned to power in     .the siblings had also

forget congress mukt bharat  is bjp planning an ally mukt party for      
text size  a  a the bjp is ambitious and wants to expand while the allies are suspicious of it.does the bjp have any alliance strategy after its split with the mehbooba mufti led pdp in jammu and kashmir political analysts are intrigued with the bjp s plans for the      lok sabha polls  given its chequered past in keeping its alliance flock together. is the bjp confident of going it alone despite the threat of the opposition uniting against it and the party s recent electoral setbacks in several bypolls the bjp s alliance politics started prominently in      when atal bihari vajpayee formed the nda government with    partners and ruled until     . when prime minister narendra modi formed his government in       although the bjp had a majority on its own  he accommodated the pre poll allies by including them in his cabinet.it is a different story now with most alliance partners openly expressing their dissatisfaction with the bjp s  big brother  attitude. the bjp s four main allies have been the shiv sena  the telugu desam party  tdp   the shiromani akali dal  sad  and the peoples democratic party  pdp . of these  ties with the tdp and the pdp have been snapped while the shiv sena has ruled out an alliance with the bjp for      polls. the akali dal too is not very happy with the bjp.hitting rough weatherthe bitterness between the bjp and the shiv sena  its oldest partner  started growing after      when the former emerged as the largest party in the maharashtra assembly. even after bjp president amit shah met sena pramukh uddhav thackeray in mumbai recently  the differences between the two parties have not been sorted out. the shiv sena won    lok sabha seats in     .the tdp  led by andhra pradesh chief minister n. chandrababau naidu  has been in and out of the nda. playing the victim  naidu decided to leave the nda in march  claiming that the centre did not give the state a special category status despite an assurance when the state was bifurcated in     . the tdp  after the sena  was the bjp s largest alliance partner with    seats in lok sabha.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowthe pdp bjp alliance was the most bizarre  and what late pdp leader mufti mohammed sayeed called as an alliance between the north pole and the south pole. it took the bjp more than three years to realise that the alliance was going nowhere. mehbooba mufti was not able to run the government in the wake of increasing terrorist attacks and rising public anger. the bjp took the lead in severing the ties with the pdp.the shiromani akali dal bjp alliance in punjab has been similar to a roller coaster ride. the sad feels that the bjp  which is a junior partner in the state  is not following the coalition dharma. after the punjab assembly election loss  the relationship between the two parties has been strained. the sad has four seats in lok sabha.the return of nitish kumar led janata dal  united  to the nda fold made smaller parties in bihar like the hindustani awam morcha  ham  and rashtriya lok samta party  rlsp  apprehensive. within the next few months  former bihar chief minister jitan ram manjhi s ham quit the nda.mollifying partners     is not the same as     . the bjp has expanded its base and has become the richest and biggest party  overtaking the congress even in rajya sabha. its winning spree continues as it has nda governments in    states.it has major presence in most big states  and is now eyeing andhra pradesh and tamil nadu. the saffron party has replaced the left in tripura and edged congress out in west bengal and odisha as the challenger to the ruling party. further growth calls for displacing allies.the party  however  is sending contradictory signals. stung by recent bypoll losses  the bjp has startedmollifying allies. the bjp and allies managed to win two of the four lok sabha seats and just one of the    assembly seats where bypolls were held in may.expressing concern over repeated defeats in bypolls  union minister upendra kushwaha noted there was something wrong.  nda should call a meeting to discuss with its allies   he said.worried about the results  bjp chief amit shah  as part of an outreach effort  landed up at uddhav thackeray s matoshree to mollify the latter. shah also met lok janshakti party  ljp  leader ram vilas paswan  who is unhappy with the bjp. the bjp tried to please the akali dal by waiving the gst on items used for langar.the bjp s outreach effort comes at a time when the congress  which is on the decline  is in the process of building coalitions state by state to challenge the bjp. the congress has realised the need for allies. the united opposition s strategy is to defeat the saffron party in      lok sabha polls.contrast this with the scenario within the nda  which has lost major allies recently even as the remaining are reassessing their future strategy. the bjp is ambitious and wants to expand while the allies are suspicious of the party. the question is  does the bjp want to be an ally mukt party or will it assuage the feelings of the allies and rebuild the coalition subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis   only you can fix it

controversial jairam ramesh has skills  but some in congress don t want him to run      war room
text size  a  a jairam ramesh is known as someone who has had many lives. the technocrat from iit has come unscathed from several controversies.the congress party s jairam ramesh has a penchant for courting controversies. and the timing of his book on p.n. haksar and his speculated appointment as the campaign coordinator for the      lok sabha elections are providing another setting for a new controversy now.a hushed campaign is seemingly on in the grand old party to deny ramesh a pivotal role in manning the congress war room at    gurudwara rakabganj road ahead of elections. all sorts of arguments are being marshalled by party leaders against ramesh  ranging from him being anti industry when he was the upa s environment minister to his tacit support for bhima koregaon accused mahesh raut. rahul gandhi  one may believe  has been repeatedly told that the party will not be able to attract funds for elections if ramesh is given the coveted assignment.tv news channel times now recently ran a series of stories pointing out how ramesh  in       had written to former maharashtra chief minister prithviraj chavan  seeking the release of raut who was detained by the local police for alleged links to maoists.in his letter  ramesh had reportedly told chavan that he had  independently inquired  into the allegations against raut and discovered that he was working well as a prime minister s rural development fellow  pmrdf .in addition  ramesh s recently released book intertwined lives  p.n. haksar and indira gandhi  published by simon   schuster  is also causing considerable bad blood for claiming that indira s principal secretary had taken on sanjay gandhi. the book claims that haksar lost the battle for supremacy  and sanjay gandhi proved to be his nemesis.haksar was not merely a principal secretary to indira gandhi from the            but acted as her moral compass in her  in famous kitchen cabinet.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowin       indira was charged with nepotism when sanjay gandhi became the lone applicant to be granted the license to manufacture a small and cheap car in india. haksar was dropped from his post for opposing the maruti project.sanjay got even with haksar later during the emergency when the latter s uncle was taken into police custody because his shop apparently did not carry individual price tags on towels and napkins  though the bundles did .  the author writes about it his book    akbar road  a short history of the people behind the fall and the rise of the congress now  son feroze varun gandhi  a bjp mp from sultanpur  was

contacted his cousins and complained about ramesh s bid to show sanjay in poor light.ramesh is known as someone who has had many lives. the technocrat from iit has come unscathed from several controversies. he described sonia gandhi as a  rabri devi  and predicted that the congress  under her  would not come to power for the next    years. sonia was furious and it required the skills of ahmed patel and ambika soni to prevail upon her to pardon ramesh.in a may      article titled  sonia  no longer the saviour   ramesh  aicc economic wing secretary at that time  is quoted as saying   two years down the line  sonia is seen as a loser and the morale in the party is low. the hype generated when sonia became party president has settled down. the mood has swung from one extreme to another. people who saw her as a ticket to nirvana now see her as a ticket to narak  hell  .in       when narasimha rao had just taken over as prime minister  the otherwise quiet party president had surprised many by blocking ramesh s entry at     akbar road for inexplicable reasons. ramesh was working as an osd in planning commission at that time.at the height of the ram setu controversy in       ramesh had attacked his ministerial colleague ambika soni  publically demanding her resignation.how does jairam ramesh get away so easily from all the troubles he actively courts  there are several reasons for it. ramesh s skill as a draftsman and ability to produce position papers on key economic and technical issues are an asset. even arch rival mani shankar aiyar complimented him once  saying if there was a good document in the congress  it was produced by either him or ramesh.over the years  ramesh is said to have contributed in sonia s speeches  letters and provided other inputs  a role

thipsay broke upper caste middle class political consensus by joining congress
text size  a  a justice abhay thipsay said he will not contest election or seek power from the congress. there is no reason to distrust him.former high court judge justice abhay thipsay joining the congress party has not only raised eyebrows but even tempers and the odd suspicions in certain circles. these are attributed to his critical observations in the controversial sohrabuddin murder case  in which amit shah  the bjp president now  is allegedly involved. when the alleged fake encounter took place and the trial was conducted  the bjp was not in power at the centre. narendra modi was a chief minister and amit shah was his prot g . justice thipsay was not a party to the judicial process then.justice thipsay s interview to the press a couple of months ago  in which he made some remarks about the way trials are being conducted and acquittals are being issued  particularly in the sohrabuddin case  are now being quoted. this is being done to undermine his joining the congress.after joining the congress  he gave an interview to the media  wherein he made it amply clear that he was worried about the direction in which the country s polity was headed. communal polarisation and enveloping majoritarianism in society were his concerns.justice thipsay s father was a freedom fighter and a strong believer of the gandhian values and nehruvian politics. justice thipsay felt that the legacy of gandhi nehru was being erased  and he thought it was his moral duty to join the party  which was the flag bearer of those values.i see no reason to question his integrity or attribute any other motive for his decision to join the congress party. he is    and  so far  has not been associated with any social or political movement  not even with any civil society groups. he is not known to be an  activist judge . indeed  even in the legal circles  he is not known for any ideological or political bias  nor has he been accused of corruption. therefore  i see no reason to accuse him of a motive in joining the congress  particularly when the party is not in power and unlikely to acquire power and glory in the near future.in short  the congress can offer nothing to lure him into the party. and indeed  if he was interested in joining politics for power  it was the bjp that was in a position to offer him governorships  commissions  national or international assignments  or cosy arbitrations. it is the bjp  despite being in power for over four years  which is desperately seeking respectability and credibility. so thipsay had a profitable option available. but he let that pass.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowone of his recent controversial decisions  i recall  was granting bail to salman khan. at that time  he was heavily trolled allegedly by the sangh parivar for appeasing khan  a muslim. later  not only was thipsay vindicated  but salman khan and his father  salim  became prominent guests at modi s functions. salman khan was shown across tv channels flying kites in modi s august company. the bonhomie between salman and modi was such that thipsay s trolling suddenly began to evaporate. but  by and large  thipsay has not been the target of any gossip  rumour or slander.then  why the trolling  attribution of motives and innuendos now  there are sociological and psychological dimensions  and both are interconnected.thipsay belongs to the middle class intelligentsia. being a high court judge  and a brahmin   he is part of the elite and enjoys some intellectual status. his clean image gives him certain social standing. people from this class and caste are known to consider the bjp as a  natural  party to work for or at least vote for. the rss  seemingly  provides them an ideological frame and platform  as well as social security and identity. in modi  they see a fulfilment of their majoritarian ambition. to be anti muslim  anti reservation  anti pakistan  and anti left are believed to have been ingrained in this caste and class. anti congressism  or rather anti nehruvism  that includes  anti dynastism    is a natural corollary and culmination of all this.thipsay defied this sociological pattern  in many ways. for some years now  this class had made the congress a political untouchable  even before modi vowed to make india  congress mukt . the media too  many argue  comes from this class and shares this bias.the congress is painted as a party of corruption  of being pro muslim  anti brahmin and anti meritocracy. the upper castes regard themselves as meritorious by birth and  therefore  cannot support a party that demands welfarist affirmative action. how can thipsay  an elite brahmin  dent the firewall like white anglo saxon protestants  wasps  in the us  this is a closed community  which dominates bureaucracy  academics  art  media  judiciary  the it industry  the nri circle  hi tech research and development field  and the vast network of public and private sector executives and managers. it is a sort of gated society that was ironically born of the congress s policies   initially from license permit raj and the public sector era   and more recently from the commanding heights achieved by the private sector and multinational corporations.after liberalisation  privatisation and globalisation  the new middle class in india became an echo chamber of the nri community.unless we understand this context  we would not be able to understand the significance of thipsay s plunge into the congress. thipsay has broken the upper caste middle class firewall. there would have been no ripples  not even a debate if he had joined the bjp  and was given a ticket by amit shah to fight an election in some urban constituency. he has made it categorically clear in his interview that he will not take part in any election or seek power from the congress. there is no reason to distrust him.kumar ketkar is a former editor and congress member of rajya sabha.subscribe to

  things that were wrong with rahul gandhi s grand iftar party
text size  a  a pranab mukherjee s presence and prominence ran contrary to rahul gandhi s iftar attempt as a goodwill gesture towards muslims.rahul gandhi s hurriedly organised iftar was a near disaster. the number of genuine rozedars   who observe the fast   was  in fact  few. invites were restricted and given in pecking order of hierarchy and status  contrary to the true spirit of ramzan and islamic concept of egalitarianism.in the absence of sonia gandhi  who is still abroad   the much touted show of opposition unity was missing. both mayawati and akhilesh yadav were conspicuous by their absence. rahul seemed more indulgent towards pranab mukherjee.the congress veterans say mukherjee has already played his cards by going to nagpur  and is now no longer politically useful for the party. the minority wing of the aicc has slipped in giving rahul an important feedback that the former president s image among muslims has taken a severe beating following his nagpur adventure. for many muslims  the description of k.b. hedgewar as a great son of india and a commentary on the     years  rule by  muslim invaders  has put mukherjee in league of p.v. narasimha rao.in a nutshell  mukherjee s presence and prominence ran contrary to rahul s iftar attempt as a goodwill gesture towards muslims.opposition no showthe other unstated goal of rahul s iftar was to showcase opposition unity. that too remained unfulfilled.although bahujan samaj party  bsp  chief mayawati sent her high level emissary in the form of satish mishra  there was no senior leader from the samajwadi party

modi s idea of self reliant india same as gandhi s   modernisation yes  western dependence no
text size  a  a prime minister narendra modi s emphasis on  atmanirbhar bharat  or self reliant india is swadeshi economics in other words.in the indian context  self reliance should not mean divorcing international trade. india will have to seriously engage with the region and the world  but at the same time strengthen its own domestic industry by streamlining the governance system and go far beyond mere amendments and announcements. swadeshi does not and should not be interpreted as isolation. m.k. gandhi s swadeshi movement and self reliance were two sides of the same coin that would find currency in a globalised world.gandhi s hind swaraj explains the  all indian economic  and political  model  in detail. for gandhi  swadeshi was the rejection of the colonial exploitation of india to add to british coffers  leading to the detriment of india s poor and the downtrodden. capitalism based on unrestricted industrial growth to feed insatiable crass consumerism became the norm of the laissez faire  free market  western economic model  which gandhi criticised in hind swaraj. the british colonial model was passed on to the us and was touted as a panacea for economic growth  with technological materialism pitted against dialectal materialism as an inevitable operative instrument. it wasn t  which is why we need swadeshi economics back.also read  modi can build  atmanirbhar  india  but only going local won t help the causethe middle paththe swadeshi model  like gandhi s hind swaraj  was not averse to technology but detested the unbridled import of all the attendant trappings of a west oriented economic model. so   modernisation yes  westernisation no  became the catchy slogan of the     s when former prime minister p.v. narasimha rao and his finance minister manmohan singh were busy dusting the indian economy out of the five decades old socialist cobwebs.the critics of rao singh s economic liberalisation strongly argued that india will face the same fate as the erstwhile ussr following the perestroika and glasnost  though there were no parallels between the two concepts. but then the protagonists of this policy of  middle path   as narasimha rao called it in his world economic forum speech at davos  originally a nehruvian idea   were shouted down by swadeshi antagonists. but neither side had a clear vision for an ideal economic model that would balance national exigencies and international compulsions. the opposition to free market economy continued when atal bihari vajpayee tried marketing swadeshi as antyodaya but could not buy peace with the proponents of the swadeshi jagaran manch  sjm   who launched a massive boycott of fdi and foreign goods.also read  modi can build  atmanirbhar  india  but only going local won t help the

ending the us china trade war.the current economic crisis is of a much larger nature compared to      or even the           economic meltdowns. will the five pillars of  atmanirbhar bharat   so eloquently enumerated by prime minister modi as economy  infrastructure  technology  vibrant demography and demand  be able to hold up india s collapsing economic edifice a post covid world is as

indigo s rahul bhatia should remember australia has been a graveyard for foreign airlines
text size  a  a what do you get for the airline magnate who has everything  if he knows what s best for him  the answer isn t  another airline. rahul bhatia  the biggest shareholder in india s biggest carrier  interglobe aviation ltd.  is evaluating data and considering a bid for virgin australia holdings ltd.  a person familiar with the matter told anurag kotoky and angus whitley of bloomberg news. he would bid via the vehicle he uses to invest in indigo  as india s biggest budget airline is known  the person said.it s not hard to see the attractions. indigo s home market is fiercely competitive  with half a dozen major carriers duking it out even after jet airways india ltd. was forced into bankruptcy last year. jet was squeezed between the loss making full service flights offered by state owned air india ltd. and indigo s own devastatingly cheap fares. australia  on the other hand  is more or less a duopoly between virgin australia   which was itself put into a coronavirus induced administration last month   and a dominant qantas airways ltd. that should offer the opportunity for the two carriers to cozily carve up the market between themselves.opportunities to break into the australian airline game don t come along often. the last time was when ansett australia ltd. collapsed just days after the sept.    attacks. a fledgling virgin australia  at the time a budget carrier named virgin blue  was perfectly placed to capitalize.despite the vast disparity in population  australia isn t that much smaller than india as a market  thanks to greater wealth and a higher propensity to fly. traffic last year came to about    billion revenue passenger kilometers  roughly the size of the fast growing indian aviation market five years ago.it also has close links to india  raising the prospect that an australian network could feed passengers via international flights into indigo s domestic web of destinations. indian australians make up close to    of the population  and the number of non resident indians   the subset of the diaspora who are most likely to take regular flights back to the motherland   is the largest after the u.k.  u.s.  singapore  nepal  and the persian gulf countries.for all that  bhatia should pass up the chance to have a crack at virgin australia. in its ruthless efficiency in controlling its home turf  qantas behaves a lot like indigo  one reason that australia has for a decade been a graveyard for ambitious foreign airlines. his best opportunities lie closer to home.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowboth qantas and indigo exploit a rare and priceless phenomenon known as the s curve  by which dominant airlines end up with more connections and a greater share of traffic the more planes they add. that makes life extremely difficult for competitors.singapore s attempt to set up a bridgehead via an outpost of its budget carrier tiger airways holdings pte. ended up being sold to virgin australia back in      at a valuation of a  .      .     after years of struggle. airasia group bhd. showed fitful interest in establishing a bigger presence down under  but ended up mostly steering clear.virgin australia itself spent years trying to break the flying kangaroo s dominance with the backing of strategic overseas players. ordinary shareholders hold less than     of the now worthless stock  with the balance being held by a rotating cast of carriers including etihad airways pjsc  singapore airlines ltd.  hainan airlines holding co.  qingdao airlines  air new zealand ltd.  and richard branson s virgin group itself. their indifference to profits enabled virgin to compete against qantas for longer than many would have thought possible  but it hasn t been enough to win the battle.the distance between australia and india is too great to make connecting the two markets an easy play  too. indigo s aircraft of choice is the airbus se a   neo  which some budget carriers have been using to open up longer range routes   but it would be operating at its limits even on flights between india and perth  which is a long way from australia s more populous east coast. that would necessitate bhatia either using an unfriendly hub airport in southeast asia  or investing in bigger  more expensive twin aisle jets.indigo is so powerful in its home market that it s natural its owners should be looking at overseas expansion   but as we ve argued  the better place for that is in the persian gulf  where a far bigger indian diaspora is closer to home and largely flown across the arabian sea on gulf carriers such as emirates.with a pandemic induced passenger drought threatening most non state backed players in the global aviation market  this is no time for bhatia to go planting seeds in australia s barren soil.   bloombergalso read  this is what happens to the world s planes when they can t fly for weekssubscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis   only

the face of it  citizen pranab mukherjee carried his nagpur date with great  lan  drawing praise from both liberals and right wing protagonists. a closer look  however  will reveal that it was more of an  act one  scene one   with enough scope for drama and dramatic events till the      electoral verdict is delivered.the unanswered questions on why the rss invited mukherjee and why he accepted it so eagerly remain. but the rss affection for mukherjee is an afterthought  and part of a bigger design. we need to wait till may      to see if the nation would require the services of a man capable of managing contradictions  and clubbing nationalism and patriotism with plurality.in delhi  what was stark was rahul gandhi s inexperience. instead of getting ahmed patel to tweet   did not expect this from pranab da    the congress would have been better off sending an emissary like a.k. antony or manmohan singh to     rajaji marg to ascertain the former president s views. such a high level interaction would have cleared misgivings and snuffed out the hype that the rss and mukherjee derived from the event.if only  rahul gandhi would learn from his mother sonia gandhi s working style. when sonia had just taken over as the congress chief in       she was upset to learn that former prime minister p.v. narasimha rao had made a submission before the constitution review panel set up by atal bihari vajpayee. the panel consisted of known sonia baiters such as p.a. sangma. fearing  foul play   the congress had decided to boycott the panel s meetings.but instead of issuing any statement against rao  sonia turned to pranab mukherjee and dispatched the veteran leader to gauge rao s mood. the chanakya of indian politics told mukherjee that he had done nothing wrong and had gone to clear indira gandhi s name in the context of accession of sikkim. rao had apparently told the panel that it was grossly wrong to view indira s move to induct sikkim as an indian state as one that had played havoc with constitutional provisions. sonia quickly gave rao a clean chit  saying she had always held him in high regard and her mother in law  too  had great regard for rao.we are deeply grateful to

nowsuch counsel is absent in rahul s congress. the absence of a new congress working committee  cwc  is hurting rahul and it will continue to hurt. even if it is packed with loyalists and lightweights  there is every possibility that a digvijaya singh  shashi tharoor  prithviraj chavan  salman khurshid  ajay maken  abhishek manu singhvi or jairam ramesh would come up with a saner counsel. unlike sonia  rahul has shown scant regard for informally summoning senior party leaders to discuss thorny issues of the day.some liberals have gone gaga over mukherjee s nagpur speech  but many of his formulations are problematic. the ease with which mukherjee described muslim rulers as  invaders  and gave the  great son of india  tag to k.b. hedgewar are some areas of concern.the rss is perhaps leaning on mukherjee s image as a devout  practising hindu. during vajpayee regime  mukherjee once got embroiled in a debate about hindu gods and goddesses. just as murli manohar joshi and others tried to corner him  mukherjee rattled appropriate shlokas  one after another  to prove his point in parliament. when the house broke  a smiling vajpayee told mukherjee   i had warned dr. joshi  he

pranab s rss speech a scathing indictment of congress  dynasty culture
text size  a  a at every step  veteran congressman pranab mukherjee seems to have been humiliated and eventually sidelined by those at the helm of the party by sole virtue of accident of birth.some sections of the commentariat beholden to the congress party as well as some members of the grand old party  including pranab mukherjee s own daughter  had expressed their reservations about the former president addressing the third year sangha shiksha varga of the rss in nagpur.it is difficult to understand the reason for this indignation. the sangh has always remained open to engaging with those who have been inimical to it in ideological terms. it is important to understand that once someone assumes the office of president of india  she he cannot be confined within the narrow boundaries of political partisanship. pranab da is  therefore  decidedly a national asset.sidelined by congressit was unfortunate that certain dynastic stooges in the congress party took to reminding the former president of his legacy as a congressman. apart from the president s own daughter  c.k. jaffer sharief  ahmed patel  p. chidambaram  currently facing investigation in the inx scam and believed to be a bitter adversary of the former president when both were colleagues in manmohan singh s cabinet  and veerappa moily had made similar points. the former home minister finance minister went ahead and said that he hoped that the former president would tell the rss what was  wrong  with its ideology.it is a bit rich on the part of these congressmen  with the exception of redoubtable sharmistha mukherjee  to remind pranab da of his legacy as a  congressman . very few senior leaders of the party are believed to have been treated as shabbily by the ruling  first family  of the congress party. many believe that after indira gandhi s assassination in       pranab mukherjee was literally thrown into the political doghouse merely for the crime of telling people that he was indeed the senior most parliamentarian in the cabinet after the demise of the prime minister.those in the know also believe that he was literally forced into political retirement by anointment as the president of india by the  first family  at the behest of certain vested interests in the manmohan singh cabinet  who were perhaps envious of his clout and competence.at every step  this veteran congressman seems to

arrogating to itself the exclusive privilege to distribute certificates of secularism to everyone. the rss or for that matter pranab da himself  who has held the highest constitutional position in the land  does not need any such certificates from the congress or its flailing leadership that has taken to celebrating  moral victories  in the absence of any real ones.pranab  rss on same pagenow  most congressmen seem to have reached the conclusion that the speech in question is an indictment of the rashtriya swayamsewak sangh  rss .on the contrary  an unbiased perusal of some of the themes that were touched upon in the course of the speech would lead one to the inescapable conclusion that the same was a scathing indictment of the culture of dynastic entitlement  which inevitably shuts out the possibility of dialogue and dissent that has enveloped the congress party.as a matter of fact  the former president seems to have been echoing the incumbent sarsanghachalak when he extolled the unity in diversity of our great country.mohan bhagwat stated clearly that the first sarsanghchalak  k.b. hedgewar  had told the swayamsewaks to not regard anyone as their enemy and stressed the importance of panthnirpekshataa or the conception of a state and nationhood  which does not subscribe to discrimination based on mode of worship.the other salient points made during the course of the speech  which may not gladden the hearts of our marxist and half marxist congress party friends  are  i  the former president clearly stated that india s nationalism is derived from universalism  and that our country was a nation even before the treaty of westphalia. this is in stark contrast to what liberals in india seem to be telling us about how india is not a nation even now. he traces india s nationhood to the mahajanapadas. again  communists and pseudo liberals may tell us that there is nothing worthwhile about ancient india. ii  he termed muslim invaders of the subcontinent for what they were   invaders  instead of airbrushing their depredations as communist historians are wont to do. iii  he also stated that the revolt of      was india s first war of independence  a phrase coined by veer savarkar. the communist historians chose to call it a  revolt   which is closer to the description british historians like g.b. malleson preferred  which was  sepoy mutiny . iv  he stressed the importance of unity in diversity and multiplicity of opinions and dialogue. this is what the rss has been practising for a while now as opposed to the dynastic and sycophantic culture of the congress party  which scotches any scope for dissent and or debate.raghav awasthi is an advocate and an rss member.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis   only

indians love cows but don t understand this intelligent animal  maneka gandhi
text size  a  a rosamund young s the secret life of cows  which surprisingly for a book on animals  has shot to the top    bestseller list of the sunday times. it is a very sweet small book about the animals she has brought up  especially the cows  at her kite s nest farm in england. she has treated them with kindness and consideration  kept them in as natural conditions as possible. and she has been rewarded with an entire world of innocence and love  play and happiness. she knows all of them by their names and describes their personalities.rosamund describes her relationship with each cow.  cows are as varied as people  she writes.  they can be highly intelligent or slow to understand  vain  considerate  proud  shy or inventive. although much of a cow s day is spent eating  they always find time for activities such as baby sitting  playing hide and seek  looking for berries. also read  veterinary services must go on  animals can t suffer during covid     modi govt tells statescows

air when happy and excited. rosamund describes how cows in trouble come to her or her brother at their house  and tell them when they are about to calve  or when they are not feeling well  so that they can be helped. they respond to their names and come from far when called. they will stare at you when they want something  panning their gaze between you and the object they want you to see till you understand.cows have different kinds of moos   voices like ours. mooing in a loud  agitated way could mean that the mother is looking for her calf. fear  disbelief  anger  hunger or distress   all of them have different sounds and a low quiet moo means she is asking you a question. cows tell the difference between people  remember those who have been kind to them and nurse grudges. they are easily offended and will ignore you until you try very hard to make friends again. but ultimately  they are forgiving. they make friends for life. they can be obstinate  gentle or aggressive. above all  they are wise. if you choose to see a cow the way you see your dog  she can be very good company.they love each other  have friends and enemies. they communicate with people   if you are willing to listen. they like music. they are problem solvers  which denotes a high degree of intelligence. the cows in my hospital sanjay gandhi animal care centre  new delhi know how to open the gates of their pens and come out when they feel like. they have food preferences too. are you listening gaushala or dairy people who feed them the same awful food day after day  when i was sending some cows to

all over as a calming grooming gesture. a cow that came to us some time ago had a prolapsed uterus. she was under immense pain and was found lying with her newborn calf on the road after two days after giving birth. she did not take her eyes off her baby  even while being stitched as the baby was being bottle fed. after she recovered  she went back to feeding the calf.bovine needs are in many respects the same as humans   freedom from stress  adequate shelter  pure food and water  liberty to exercise  to wander about  to go for a walk  or just to stand and stare. every animal needs the congenial company of its own species and a cow needs to be allowed to enjoy her  rights  in her own way  in her own time  and not according to a human timetable. the number of ways a calf may be treated is no less than the number of ways a child may be treated.  a badly treated calf is simply a neglected  ill nourished  lonely frightened child   says rosamund young in the secret life of cows.if a cow senses danger  then none of the cows around will sleep. if the source of danger is remote  cows will communicate to the calves that they can sleep while the older ones keep guard.also

stand in an indiscriminate herd till they die. they have no names and no individual recognition here.dr sujoy khanna and i have co authored the only manual in india on gaushalas and we have a chapter detailing what cows like and what they fear  how to approach them and how to recognise their moods.even the people who keep cows in their homes  who should know better about their personalities  don t bother to be nice to them or even understand them. cows are kept tied most of the day  milked  their children separated at birth and tied a few unattainable feet away from their mothers. for such people  it is simply an animal tied to a post whose only thought presumably is of fodder. for owners  it is easy to assume that an animal has no feelings. they can then be treated as generators of profit without any thought to their needs. and yet  the same people will worship the idol of kamdhenu in their house.the secret life of cows should be made compulsory reading in schools  especially for people who have the compassion to run gaushalas. if animals are to survive  people must realise that they are like them  existing just in another form. anyone who eats an animal is eating

rahul gandhi is back. now with two economists  a migrant aid pack and an ethical hacker
text size  a  a it takes a lot to be defeated twice over  ridiculed for years and still care enough to show up for your country  the majority of which has rejected you for a national leadership role. rahul gandhi continues to surprise us. he simply won t give up. he just doesn t turn cynical and walk away.he keeps coming back with his empathy as well as his willingness to find viable solutions to pressing issues induced by the pandemic  an economy in doldrums  a huge migrant workers  problem that s slowly turned into a humanitarian crisis as well as transparency of the government s arogya setu app being used to map covid positive patients. rahul gandhi s comeback is all the more conspicuous against the backdrop of prime minister narendra modi s unwillingness to have a press conference.also read  pmo cannot fight covid    alone  need to empower strong cms  says rahul gandhirahul is ready to talkrahul gandhi is the eternal unputdownable comeback kid. he has managed to hold the attention of the media by continuously participating in the process of finding answers to the problems that covid has thrown at india. he has had two conversations with two economists par excellence  former rbi governor raghuram rajan and nobel laureate abhijit banerjee. add to this  the migrant aid pack that sonia gandhi offered  where the congress party would have paid the train fare for every migrant labourer who wants to go home. this  masterstroke  has made the fiercest of critics of the congress party applaud the gandhis. the gandhis are consciously and conspicuously placing themselves polar opposite to narendra modi. whatever modi is avoiding  the gandhis are accepting and dealing squarely.right wing editorials are claiming that rahul gandhi is trying to come off as an  intellectual . this  for a man who till recently they caustically made fun of. but this perception is cracking because for the first time  the entire bjp pr machinery is being used to not make fun of rahul gandhi  but to discredit his interactions with the two economists by either calling the interaction a  repackaged socialist snake oil  or by spinning fake news related to the guests. moneycontrol.com and news

attack modi with his  chowkidar chor hai  jibe or give him a hug in parliament and say that he loves the prime minister.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and

urges the government to transfer direct cash to the poor  as envisaged in congress s nyay scheme  by saying  call it  nyay   justice  or call it by any other name but do it. rahul  it appears  has specifically distanced himself from acts of political pettiness and his statements reflect a sense of political maturity   we can defeat the virus if we fight it together  we lose if we fight with each other . even though he also unapologetically added that he does not agree with prime minister narendra modi on most things but wanted to offer  constructive suggestions .gandhi s well directed

mistake. french hacker elliot alderson on twitter looked into the aarogya setu app and confirmed rahul s fear that it was nothing more than a  sophisticated surveillance system . the app s user agreement states that the data can be used in the future for purposes other than epidemic control if there is a legal requirement. the privacy policy of the app states that the data on the app may be shared with as many agencies as the government sees fit.alderson went on to confirm and tweeted to the government that  a security issue has been found in your app. the privacy of    million indians is at stake.  he ended the tweet with a post script that read    rahul gandhi was right. although the modi government confirmed that there could be no security breach in the app  they thanked the ethical hacker on engaging with them. alderson on the other hand has confirmed that some of the issues he reported were fixed in the app and that he did receive calls from the national informatics centre  nic  and the indian computer emergency response team  icert   both government bodies.in fact the press note of aarogya setu thanked alderson for engaging with them.  we thank the ethical hacker on engaging with us. we encourage any users who identify a vulnerability to inform us immediately.  alderson  however  maintained that the app should  stop lying  stop denying .rahul s initial warning  as early as    february  foreboding the government of ignoring the contagion almost seems prophetic today. the bjp can go on to dismiss him but it s getting harder for the party and the

sonia gandhi wants modi to suspend central vista. but this urban harakiri must be scrapped
text size  a  a in the wake of the covid    pandemic  opposition from several experts and leaders  including congress party president sonia gandhi  to prime minister narendra modi s grand central vista project in new delhi has coalesced around the view that it should be suspended  and the budget re allocated for more pressing and urgent health requirements. suspending the project also offers the opportunity to re evaluate the proposal from an architectural and urban design perspective  because it was justified largely on those grounds.the project has never been subjected to thorough public scrutiny. in fact  it veils insidious political agendas  dangerous environmental and procedural compromises  and an unconscionable usurping of public spaces for government use. not least  it is the banal  militaristic architecture and urban design that mutilates a potential unesco world heritage site listing. it is an urban harakiri.the modi government is  however  obdurate and proceeding with manic speed on this suicidal mission. all objections will be addressed  it says.also read  modi s central vista plan shows indian urban planners are as complicit in destroying heritagewhere are the studies today  seven months into the project  the cynical nature of the modi government s assurances is apparent. in juridical terms  the government has substituted  rule of law  with  rule by law . a complicit bureaucracy and a compliant judiciary enable the project proponent to alter the master plan for delhi      to suit the proposed revamp.development control norms are being enhanced by permitting the use of transport oriented development  tod  incentives that are normally offered to increase ridership along metro routes serving dense urban corridors. the result is that the quantum of construction proposed for the central vista project far exceeds the sustainable holding capacity of this master plan designated heritage precinct. all this  we are assured  is being done legally.there are other egregious faults. prudent administrative and fiscal practices dictate that large architectural and urban projects of this scale and scope should be backed by exhaustive management studies  heritage and environmental impact assessment studies  traffic and transport evaluations  detailed project reports and  of course  wide public consultation. there is no evidence that these prerequisites have been followed. instead  what is evident is that the project is following a plan as you go roadmap.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowalso read  narendra modi wants to rebuild new delhi for no good reasonagainst delhi master plan objectivein architectural and urban design terms  it relies on self serving assumptions without examining alternative options. it assumes  for example  that a new parliament building is required to cater to an expected increase in the number of parliamentarians  implicitly jettisoning the historical  cultural and psychological value of continuing to use the existing building as a potent symbol of indian democracy.in the united kingdom  for example  with a roughly similar situation  its historic parliament building is being carefully upgraded to accommodate the house of commons  while a new house of lords will be built in york as a political gesture to promote regional inclusivity.ad hoc perceptions appear to rationalise the construction of ten square doughnut shaped  multi storeyed buildings to accommodate all government offices  assuming that the consolidation of government offices in a centralised location will make for efficient functioning. where are the management studies to justify this contrarian logic  it flies against the current worldwide trend to downscale government offices  decentralise and rely on digital technologies to promote efficient and effective delivery of government services. more importantly  it goes against the cardinal objective of the delhi master plan      to decentralise government offices.also read  delhi power corridor makeover will cost rs        crore  but there are no funds for it yetdoes cost justify benefit an important principle of prudent project management is the

sonia gandhi wants modi to suspend central vista. but this urban harakiri must be scrapped
text size  a  a in the wake of the covid    pandemic  opposition from several experts and leaders  including congress party president sonia gandhi  to prime minister narendra modi s grand central vista project in new delhi has coalesced around the view that it should be suspended  and the budget re allocated for more pressing and urgent health requirements. suspending the project also offers the opportunity to re evaluate the proposal from an architectural and urban design perspective  because it was justified largely on those grounds.the project has never been subjected to thorough public scrutiny. in fact  it veils insidious political agendas  dangerous environmental and procedural compromises  and an unconscionable usurping of public spaces for government use. not least  it is the banal  militaristic architecture and urban design that mutilates a potential unesco world heritage site listing. it is an urban harakiri.the modi government is  however  obdurate and proceeding with manic speed on this suicidal mission. all objections will be addressed  it says.also read  modi s central vista plan shows indian urban planners are as complicit in destroying heritagewhere are the studies today  seven months into the project  the cynical nature of the modi government s assurances is apparent. in juridical terms  the government has substituted  rule of law  with  rule by law . a complicit bureaucracy and a compliant judiciary enable the project proponent to alter the master plan for delhi      to suit the proposed revamp.development control norms are being enhanced by permitting the use of transport oriented development  tod  incentives that are normally offered to increase ridership along metro routes serving dense urban corridors. the result is that the quantum of construction proposed for the central vista project far exceeds the sustainable holding capacity of this master plan designated heritage precinct. all this  we are assured  is being done legally.there are other egregious faults. prudent administrative and fiscal practices dictate that large architectural and urban projects of this scale and scope should be backed by exhaustive management studies  heritage and environmental impact assessment studies  traffic and transport evaluations  detailed project reports and  of course  wide public consultation. there is no evidence that these prerequisites have been followed. instead  what is evident is that the project is following a plan as you go roadmap.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust

delhi for no good reasonagainst delhi master plan objectivein architectural and urban design terms  it relies on self serving assumptions without examining alternative options. it assumes  for example  that a new parliament building is required to cater to an expected increase in the number of parliamentarians  implicitly jettisoning the historical  cultural and psychological value of continuing to use the existing building as a potent symbol of indian democracy.in the united kingdom  for example  with a roughly similar situation  its historic parliament building is being carefully upgraded to accommodate the house of commons  while a new house of lords will be built in york as a political gesture to promote regional inclusivity.ad hoc perceptions appear to rationalise the construction of ten square doughnut shaped  multi storeyed buildings to accommodate all government offices  assuming that the consolidation of government offices in a centralised location will make for efficient functioning. where are the management studies to justify this contrarian logic  it flies against the current worldwide trend to downscale government offices  decentralise and rely on digital technologies to promote efficient and effective delivery of government services. more importantly  it goes against the cardinal objective of the delhi master plan      to decentralise government offices.also read  delhi power corridor makeover will cost rs        crore  but there are no funds for it yetdoes cost justify benefit an important principle of prudent project management is the

shaheen bagh couldn t get caa revoked. but gandhi s satyagraha didn t meet its goal either
text size  a  a as shaheen bagh protests are disbanded  there is much debate on what it achieved and whether it lost value by the abrupt end because of the coronavirus pandemic. the anti caa protests at shaheen bagh have often been likened with satyagraha  a gandhian form of non violent protest. now  it s worth pondering how m.k. gandhi s famous satyagraha movement outcomes weighed against their direct and indirect goals.worth his saltthe dandi march in      was perhaps the most celebrated movement that gandhi led during his lifetime      km march from ahmedabad to dandi over    days against unjust imposition of salt tax.but notice the difference between the material aim and outcome.just four days before the march  gandhi declared   i want to deprive the government of its illegitimate monopoly of salt. my aim is to get the salt tax abolished. that is for me one step  the first step  towards full freedom.   the collected works of mahatma gandhi  vol.     page    many leaders were not sure of the propriety of building national movement around an issue like salt tax. but in a letter to then viceroy lord irwin  gandhi declared he would proceed with fellow ashramites  to disregard the provisions of the salt laws   which  according to gandhi  were  most iniquitous of all  taxes  from the poor man s standpoint .  cwmg  vol.     page   in march       almost a year after the march and just days before gandhi irwin pact was signed  viceroy irwin considered the issue of salt  tax    one of  the three matters of principle on which accommodation was impossible .  cwmg  vol.     page     gandhi issued a long statement to the press on the day the pact was signed  but made no mention of the salt laws or salt tax in it.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowa telegram to provincial congress committees was sent the same day explaining the government order  presumably drafted by gandhi  according to the book    no organised disobedience of salt laws and no raids but villagers residing in the areas where salt collected or made are permitted to continue to collect or make salt for domestic consumption or sale in neighbourhood but no sale or trading outside.   cwmg vol.     page     gandhi knew he didn t achieve what he set out to do apparently  but he considered the salt march successful in terms of the spirit it awakened in society and activated the masses for civil disobedience and sacrifices.also read  delhi police clears shaheen bagh protest site amid coronavirus threatgaining grounds in bardolithe result of the famous bardoli satyagraha  two years before the dandi march  was not very different either.led by vallabhbhai patel under gandhi s guidance  people of bardoli taluka in south gujarat fought against the new    per cent increase in land tax. local leaders briefed gandhi that people were willing to pay according to the old assessment.but gandhi s demand was one step higher. he wanted the people to not pay any land tax at all unless and until the new tax assessment measure was cancelled by the government. he said   declare the enhancement cancelled and then take the old assessment which we are prepared to pay.   the story of bardoli  mahadev desai  navajivan publishing house  ahmedabad        page    .vallabhbhai patel  who had no base at bardoli at that time  went there and led the satyagraha. he warned the people to think twice before taking the plunge into the satyagraha   you must bear clearly in mind that except your capacity for suffering and grim determination  you have nothing to fight government s brute strength with.   the story of bardoli  page    the satyagraha began with a pledge  recitation from quran  a kabir bhajan and ram dhun. there were many atrocities  ranging from confiscating of people s cattle to attaching land. but people remained defiant.in the end  bardoli satyagraha came to an end after nearly six months without fulfilling the original demand of complete rollback of the increased land tax. the enhancements fixed for bardoli and adjoining choryasi talukas were reduced from rs          to rs       .  the story of bardoli  page     .on the face of it  the satyagraha did not achieve total cancellation of the enhancement as a precondition. but other important gains were made. a sleepy taluka attained nationwide fame and has been compared with thermopylae  the famed battle in which outnumbered greeks fought bravely against the persian army  by famous hindi poet maithili sharan gupt. noted hindi writer munshi premchand gave a touching tribute to the sacrifices made by the people

shaheen bagh couldn t get caa revoked. but gandhi s satyagraha didn t meet its goal either
text size  a  a as shaheen bagh protests are disbanded  there is much debate on what it achieved and whether it lost value by the abrupt end because of the coronavirus pandemic. the anti caa protests at shaheen bagh have often been likened with satyagraha  a gandhian form of non violent protest. now  it s worth pondering how m.k. gandhi s famous satyagraha movement outcomes weighed against their direct and indirect goals.worth his saltthe dandi march in      was perhaps the most celebrated movement that gandhi led during his lifetime      km march from ahmedabad to dandi over    days against unjust imposition of salt tax.but notice the difference between the material aim and outcome.just four days before the march  gandhi declared   i want to deprive the government of its illegitimate monopoly of salt. my aim is to get the salt tax abolished. that is for me one step  the first step  towards full freedom.   the collected works of mahatma gandhi  vol.     page    many leaders were not sure of the propriety of building national movement around an issue like salt tax. but in a letter to then viceroy lord irwin  gandhi declared he would proceed with fellow ashramites  to disregard the provisions of the salt laws   which  according to gandhi  were  most iniquitous of all  taxes  from the poor man s standpoint .  cwmg  vol.     page   in march       almost a year after the march and just days before gandhi irwin pact was signed  viceroy irwin considered the issue of salt  tax    one of  the three matters of principle on which accommodation was impossible .  cwmg  vol.     page     gandhi issued a long statement to the press on the day the pact was signed  but made no mention of the salt laws or salt tax in it.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowa telegram to provincial congress committees was sent the same day explaining the government order  presumably drafted by gandhi  according to the book    no organised disobedience of salt laws and no raids but villagers residing in the areas where salt collected or made are permitted to continue to collect or make salt for domestic consumption or sale in neighbourhood but no sale or trading outside.   cwmg vol.     page     gandhi knew he didn t achieve what he set out to do apparently  but he considered the salt march successful in terms of the spirit it awakened in society and activated the masses for civil disobedience and sacrifices.also read  delhi police clears shaheen bagh protest site amid coronavirus threatgaining grounds in bardolithe result of the famous bardoli satyagraha  two years before the dandi march  was not very different either.led by vallabhbhai patel under gandhi s guidance  people of bardoli taluka in south gujarat fought against the new    per cent increase in land tax. local leaders briefed gandhi that people were willing to pay according to the old assessment.but gandhi s demand was one step higher. he wanted the people to not pay any land tax at all unless and until the new tax assessment measure was cancelled by the government. he said   declare the enhancement cancelled and then take the old assessment which we are prepared to pay.   the story of bardoli  mahadev

taking the plunge into the satyagraha   you must bear clearly in mind that except your capacity for suffering and grim determination  you have nothing to fight government s brute strength with.   the story of bardoli  page    the satyagraha began with a pledge  recitation from quran  a kabir bhajan and ram dhun. there were many atrocities  ranging from confiscating of people s cattle to attaching land. but people remained defiant.in the end  bardoli satyagraha came to an end after nearly six months without fulfilling the original demand of complete rollback of the increased land tax. the enhancements fixed for bardoli and adjoining choryasi talukas were reduced from rs          to rs       .  the story of bardoli  page     .on the face of it  the satyagraha did not achieve total

india s leadership during covid     modi s thali plan and rahul gandhi s no plan
text size  a  a the coronavirus pandemic is making a bigger footprint in india every day. it s something everyone agrees has to be fought on priority   from prime minister narendra modi to kerala chief minister pinarayi vijayan  from maharashtra cm uddhav thackeray to west bengal cm mamata banerjee.as of now  there are     confirmed cases of covid    in india. but doctors and experts have said it s just the tip of the iceberg because india hasn t been testing adequately. no matter if you considered modi s janata curfew sunday a success or not  with a population of over  .  billion people  india should be bracing for much worse.and in times like these  leadership counts. donald trump will forever be remembered for his careless handling of coronavirus in the us and singapore pm lee hsien loong for his timely  action oriented handling of cases in his country  so much so  that the country didn t have to go into lockdown.so  how does prime minister narendra modi fare  and what about  chanakya  amit shah  india s home minister  it is also the job of the opposition to make sure the government is doing the right thing in these tough times. so  what is rahul gandhi doing also read  india locks down to prevent covid    spread   here are restrictions imposed in your statethe janata curfewprime minister modi addressed this dark moment in india s history thursday by speaking to the nation through a live telecast speech and letting us know the gravity of the situation. self isolation  he said  is a must. we were told to observe a  janata curfew  or a self imposed curfew sunday and clap on balconies or clang plates to cheer blue collar workers and medical staff at   pm.the   pm plate clanging and clapping happened with the kind of pomp and show that we see during a baraat  jaagran and diwali. if the  festivities  happened on balconies  it would still look cute  but people stepped down from their homes on to the streets to  come together  against the disease. and that destroyed the whole point of the exercise. instead of celebrating our medical heroes  we ended up disrespecting exactly what they asked us to do  which is  to be responsible citizens and not overwhelm the medical staff by maintaining distance and avoiding community transmission. perhaps  the pm needed to spell it out more clearly for indians. they stayed in all day and came out at   pm to undo it.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowthe problem is that at no point did the prime minister speak about the actual steps the government is taking to tackle the novel coronavirus pandemic in india. what are we doing to test patients  do we have enough testing kits  how much are we spending on hospital space  staff  beds  ventilators  are we following the south korean model of more testing and no lockdown to contain the spread of the virus  we were instead told that finance minister nirmala sitharaman will be heading a special task force to tackle the pandemic. till now  no financial package has been announced by the modi government. abstract ideas and one day of semi successful quarantine are not going to help india now  neither is it going to reflect well on modi s leadership.also  considering how the economy is at the precipice of a major downward spiral  with businesses virtually shutting down  spreading the finance minister thin in tackling an epidemic doesn t seem to be the wisest of decisions. and that too a minister who is often criticised for not doing her job as the finance minister well.also read  coronavirus  latest updates on cases in india  all you need to know about covid   grand old no showthe opposition too has a role as a leader during a pandemic. keep people calm  ask them to cooperate and quarantine  and ask the government about measures being taken. but then there s rahul gandhi whose tweets are constantly reminding us that we better panic since india is going to pay an extremely  heavy price  for the government s inability to act decisively. so  for a moment  let s pay heed to rahul gandhi s call for a quicker action. but here too  what steps is someone like rahul gandhi  who has figured out the disaster we are heading towards  suggesting we take and sonia gandhi and priyanka gandhi aren t helping us figure that out either.again  it is the regional parties and leaders who have taken the lead in the fight against coronavirus.kerala s pinarayi vijayan has announced a rs        crore financial package  which includes a rs     crore health package to tackle coronavirus in a state that just has    infected patients so far. he has announced free food grain  subsidised meals  tax relief and arrear clearance along with  facilitating rs      crore in consumer loans through self help group kudumbashree to those impacted by covid    . social welfare pensions of april will be released in march itself in kerala. meals will be served at rs   . these are real time  actual steps that can tackle the pandemic and its economic cost.also read  janata curfew is modi s  nd stab at social mobilisation  but it can be a double edged swordrahul gandhi should have tweeted what congress governments in punjab  chhattisgarh and rajasthan are doing to fight covid    because the rest of the opposition is wasting no time to reassure the people of their states. for example  west bengal chief minister mamata banerjee has announced that the state government will provide rice for free for the next six months in ration shops to make sure no one goes without food in these dire times  benefiting  .  crore people of the state.arvind kejriwal has reassured the people of delhi that his government is prepared to handle the covid    crisis. he has arranged dusib flats for patients  which have been vacant for a long time  and installed     isolation beds in delhi government hospitals. in fact  he has gone a step ahead and added rooms in under construction hospitals of the delhi government for the purpose. delhi is now in a lockdown.this is a time for the community to remain alert and morally uplifted. and for that  we need the narendra modi government as well as the opposition  including the gandhi family  to stand up for science and practicality  if not solidarity.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis   only you can fix it you are reading this because you value good  intelligent and objective

we the people must save the software of indian democracy beyond bjp congress whataboutery
text size  a  a if democracy was just about free and fair elections  india would be the world s greatest democracy. there are many issues in the way our elections are held  but for a messy  third world country of our size  it is a big deal that we  still  have largely free and fair elections.however  india s ranking in the global democracy index for      put out by the economist intelligence unit  eiu  fell ten points to   . the reason for this  according to the eiu  was an erosion in civil liberties.the apparatus needed for a healthy democracy goes beyond elections to unelected institutions  the judiciary  the press  the reserve bank of india  the election commission of india  the comptroller and auditor general  cag   the lokpal  the central bureau of investigation  cbi   the tax agencies  the police  and so on. even an institution we don t think much about in india s political discourse  the armed forces  need to play their part by remaining politically neutral and committed to democratic ideals.when narendra modi was waging his campaign to become prime minister the first time in       many felt that our institutions would keep modi s excesses in check. after all  we have one of the world s most activist judiciaries  and our free press was bringing upa   to its knees.six years later  we see the shameful sight of a recently retired chief justice of india  cji  nominated to the rajya sabha. enough and more has been said on why justice ranjan gogoi s appointment is a blight on india s judicial independence. this is hardly a first. in      itself  the modi government made another recently retired chief justice  p. sathasivam  the governor of kerala.from arun jaitley to justice gogoi himself  all the important people in india agree that post retirement jobs compromise judicial independence. except that they agree with this sentiment only when they are not in power or not seeking power with the same compromise.also read  blame amit shah for uapa changes but nehru  indira ignored civil liberties toowe are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowcorrupted absolutelythe cases of gogoi and sathasivam are a bit too brazen  but it is not as if the congress or others have not used the same carrot of post retirement jobs to play games with the judiciary. the rule of thumb is this  the more powerful a government  the more it pushes and shoves its way ahead of independent institutions. for instance  despite the shame of the emergency  rajiv gandhi was trying to muzzle the freedom of the press with a  defamation  bill  because his absolute majority allowed him to do so. the pushback from the press made him go back on it.a lot of indira gandhi s defenders insist she was a democrat at heart  and yet she imposed the emergency. power corrupts  said lord acton  and absolute power corrupts absolutely. whether it is the congress or the bharatiya janata party  bjp  or any other political party  whether it is indira gandhi or narendra modi or any other person  india will always have this problem of an executive seeking to ride roughshod over independent institutions through whatever means possible.that is why we need a bipartisan conversation on strengthening our institutions. we need to think afresh  and think long term  beyond the present political moment. it is easy to be led astray by the congress bjp  left right whataboutery. in this great year of the revival of constitutional nationalism  we need to think as partisans only of the constitution of india  and ask  what changes do we need in the judiciary so that we can make it immune to the electoral heft the government of the day carries the demand for a cooling off period for post retirement jobs for judges  or for not holding political office  or revising the collegium system of appointment of judges   these debates and issues should be made central to our political conversation. as the supreme court of india becomes a defanged  executive court   this is the right time to think about the institution with the long view of the future.also read  legal autocrats are on the rise. they use constitution and democracy to destroy bothwe the guardians of democracyit reflects poorly on all of us that we had to pressure the government to have an independent system of appointing the election commissioners. surely  it does not sound right that the election commissioners are appointed by the president of india on the advice of the prime minister  which prime minister would make the mistake of not appointing a yes man there l.k. advani had proposed a collegium system to involve the opposition leader and the chief justice of india in appointing the election commissioners  as senior journalist d.k. singh recently reminded us. the manmohan singh government didn t agree in     . nobody wants to relinquish their powers. it is we the people who have to force the political class to have this conversation.most of the indian media has become a mouthpiece of the government and the ruling bjp. we need an equivalent of the first amendment in the united states to ensure press freedom.if we get a congress government in power tomorrow  it won t pursue media freedom. it is more likely that it will be taking a leaf out of the modi playbook and making the media its own mouthpiece. it is civil society that will have to help create a consensus that we need to do something to ensure greater media independence. how  for example  can the government get away with refusing to grant new licenses for news channels  and why does such red tape not affect arnab goswami s expanding empire india s political parties will pay lip service to such issues only until they are in opposition. remember how narendra modi protested section   a of the information technology act  which was used to arrest social media users for political speech  but when modi became pm  his government went on to defend   a before the supreme court. when the court read down the provision  former communications minister kapil sibal welcomed the decision.in these brazen games  those occupying the chair murder democracy to make themselves more powerful. there are enough people to speak up for the bjp and the congress in india. we now need people to speak up for democracy  so that we may be able to prevent the next supreme court judge from eyeing political office.the author is contributing editor to theprint. views are personal.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis   only you can fix it you are reading this because you

maharaja scindia has shown congress the way  find other npas within and get cracking
text size  a  a the writing was on the wall. jyotiraditya madhavrao scindia s exit from the congress and his prompt entry into the bharatiya janata party exposes the existential crisis within the grand old party. but scindia is just an example. the congress still has many npas   or non performing assets   about whom the party will have to decide sooner or later  or be prepared for more scindia like moments.the congress is peppered with leaders who are ideologically dodgy and therefore untrustworthy. the party s trials and tribulations will peak now since many of the prominent faces it heavily invested in are rumoured to be all set to leave for greener pastures. scindia s exit will have a domino effect because  apparently  the congress isn t worth all the struggle.also read  scindia

for  secularism  anti rss  anti hindutva. scindia could be a case study on why someone would give up an envious career in a political party that treated him like royalty  pun intended .but it isn t like scindia wasn t giving the signs as to which direction the wind was blowing.the congress party s stand on the dilution of article     was clear from the beginning   that the narendra modi government s way of going about it was unconstitutional. but there were leaders in the party   yes  like our very own jyotiraditya scindia   who were more than willing to hail the government for its  nationalistic  move. and many did.but as scindia goes about  correcting  everything he said or did until a few months ago   from criticising modi for putting  my entire hindustan in danger  to showering praise on him because  india s future is in his safe hands    he leaves behind a template for the congress party to study and figure out who its next scindias are.we are deeply grateful to

the modi government s article     move was congress  raebareli mla aditi singh. often dubbed as the rising star of the congress  she celebrated the removal of jammu and kashmir s special status. when the congress  stance was pointed out to her  she resorted to calling herself  an indian first  to justify her position. this only suggests that for aditi singh  her party s stand was  anti india .in november       aditi singh had attended a special session of uttar pradesh assembly called by the yogi adityanath government instead of her own party s training session held in raebareli. for defying the party whip  a show cause notice was issued to singh. not much has happened since then  though. neither has aditi left the congress  which many suspected her to  nor has the congress  predictably  taken further action against her.milind deora  here s another leader who seems to be playing the odd even scheme. deora looks like a true blue congressi one day and not quite one another day. deora has courted controversy for being on the fence on various issues that the congress has held a clear stand. for example  milind deora s take on the article     move is the definition of sitting on the fence. deora s tweet was so cryptic that it s hard to know what he was actually trying to convey. he compared article     with demonetisation and hoped the decision would  play out more favourably .deora also heaped praises on the aam aadmi party  aap  recently. although it appears to be very statesman like for deora to praise the delhi government for becoming the most fiscally prudent  it didn t go down well with his colleagues in the party s delhi unit. he was criticised for patting the aap on its back even as his own party scored a zero in the      assembly election. leaders like ajay

jammu and kashmir chief minister omar abdullah tweeted and asked prasada why he could not categorically deny that he wasn t joining the bjp instead of beating around the bush. prasada has been a one time minister and yet the congress party has not done much to pull him up. it was also reported by times now that prasada was seen in and out of the bjp offices.anil shastri  then there s former prime minister lal bahadur shastri s son anil shastri  a senior congress leader who has openly asked the party to rethink its ideology by judging the mood of the people. for those who need this to be spelled out  the mood must be that of hindu nationalism perhaps.in       anil shastri had spent over an hour with rss chief mohan bhagwat at lal bahadur shastri s ancestral house in ramnagar

and sharing a stage with bhagwat at a religious event  has not done much for the congress either  except bring some embarrassment to the party. his son samir was  inspired by narendra modi  to choose the bjp over the congress.the question that remains is  why isn t the congress cutting ties with members who clearly have a problem with the party s stand  and are going to either embarrass it or bring its way unnecessary criticism and public scrutiny  the other question is for these congress leaders  are they buying time to save their sinking political career  more importantly  are these the

jyotiraditya didn t want to become rahul. he could ve become sachin. will end up like varun
text size  a  a there are two and only two kinds of politicians. one is a politician whose power comes from the masses  the other is a politician whose power comes from the party.the first kind is called a mass leader  the second a darbari.darbaris are dispensable  or history dispenses with them anyway. mass leaders are the real deal. a mass leader can have his or her way within the party  ride roughshod over rivals within the party. that s how narendra modi dispensed with the delhi darbar of the bjp in       forcing it to concede to his demand of being officially declared prime ministerial candidate.rahul gandhi has been losing the battle to the old guard of his party because he himself is not a popular mass leader. rahul gandhi draws his power from the congress party  so the party decides how powerful he is going to be.despite the decline of the congress since       there has been no split in the party. that s because there are very few mass leaders left. those who are mass leaders  are not doing too badly for themselves  such as amarinder singh and ashok gehlot.if you read the fascinating story of how mamata banerjee quit the congress and formed her own party  the difference between darbaris and mass leaders becomes starkly clear. the darbaris within the west bengal unit of the congress who were using the party structure to keep mamata at bay have become footnotes in history. mamata is the chief minister  without the congress.the likes of mamata banerjee and sharad pawar never felt the need to return to the congress because they drew their legitimacy

well as state congress chief  a post he has held for six years now. this is because he is positioning himself as a leader with the masses behind him. he is using his voters against his party.at the same time  pilot couldn t get the better of ashok gehlot not because gehlot had the backing of delhi. in the rajasthan assembly election  gehlot was able to show who the bigger mass leader was. it is said that you could go to any village in rajasthan and find at least one man who will say he personally knows ashok gehlot.sachin pilot used to be spoken of in the same breath as jyotiraditya scindia. both come from dynasty and wear arrogance on their sleeve. arrogance can also be used as strength  to project oneself as a strong leader  for instance. sachin pilot is using it to present himself as the wronged underdog.but arrogance of surname sticks out like a sore thumb. scindia s arrogance is about being former royalty   he doesn t see himself as  former . it s      and he wants to be maharaja. there was one former royal who went on to become prime minister  vishwanath pratap singh. he did so by giving up his properties and becoming a man of the masses. that s the kind of sacrifice

sweeping election victory. why couldn t scindia have done that also read  these are the   key young congress leaders  sidelined  like jyotiraditya scindia wasmaharaja and his subjectsunlike sachin pilot  scindia did not try mass leadership in madhya pradesh after     . he preferred the five star delhi circuit. among his reasons for quitting the congress party  scindia said that the congress was not what it used to be. yet  as a prominent face of the congress  is he also not responsible for the bleak state of the party scindia could not win his traditional family seat of guna in the      lok sabha elections. he can blame the modi wave for it. after all  rahul gandhi couldn t save amethi either. but in madhya pradesh  kamal nath was able to save his traditional seat chhindwara  transferring it to his son nakul nath. in guna  jyotiraditya scindia lost to his former aide  krishna pal singh yadav  who was insulted by scindia s wife in the election in classist terms. he played the underdog against the arrogant maharaja and won. scindia couldn t keep his own house in order  and now blames the party. such was his commitment to his party that he travelled to the us for his son s convocation  happily posting a photo  while the lok sabha elections were still going on.after the results  scindia was left high and dry. the congress didn t give him anything at all. scindia understandably feared becoming rahul gandhi  a man waiting for lady luck to shine on him. kamal nath and digvijaya singh ganged up to force scindia into a corner  leaving him with no option but to rebel.also read  the many hurdles jyotiraditya scindia faces in bjp before he can fulfil his dreamsbut scindia had another option  to take to mass politics. he has chosen the easy way out  a business

rebellion rather than  operation kamal . there was a time when the bjp needed a part of indira gandhi s dynasty. in       maneka and varun gandhi joined the party. today maneka gandhi is not even a minister. varun gandhi  who comically projected himself as a cm aspirant in uttar pradesh  is out of the headlines.understandably  jyotiraditya scindia did not want to end up as rahul gandhi. he could

jyotiraditya scindia calling out congress when it is down and out is just bad sportsmanship
text size  a  a there was a time when the congress had leaders but no party. after the jyotiraditya scindia quitting episode  there is no party and no leadership. after scindia quit and joined the bjp  the two top leaders of the mother son party have left the chief minister of madhya pradesh to salvage the sinking government alone. as scindia said  the congress party is unwilling to see the reality.soon after he joined the bjp  scindia was announced as a candidate for the rajya sabha seat from madhya pradesh  though this was not mentioned by scindia as a reason to join the bjp.going by the pathetic condition of the congress party under rahul gandhi and sonia gandhi  it will not be a surprise if more scindias begin to make a beeline for the bjp.also read  these are the   key young congress leaders  sidelined  like jyotiraditya scindia wasnot a real losswhile his quitting the congress is not seen as a great loss to that party  it is doubtful if scindia joining will greatly help the bjp in elections. both the parties will  therefore  have to draw their respective balance sheets and determine whether scindia was a non performing asset or prospective gain.the scion of the scindia family who was considered very close to the gandhi family enjoyed a special status in the congress party. but jyotiradtiya scindia was seldom considered a strategist of electoral politics. as general secretary in charge of the congress in western uttar pradesh during the      lok sabha election  his tally was zero. the only seat the congress won was that of sonia gandhi in raebareli  obviously due to her own merit and to some extent  her daughter s charisma of  resembling her grandmother .the bjp s vote share in madhya pradesh assembly election fell from   .  per cent in      to   .  per cent in       it was still better than that of the congress    .     even though the congress got five seats more than that of the bjp. in all this  scindia s contribution was practically next to nil. in the      lok sabha election  the bjp won    out of    seats only due to modi s appeal and shivraj singh chouhan s efforts and sympathy that  a good man   mama ji   lost with very less margin .we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowthe congress did not need scindia to win elections. obviously his claim to chief ministership was overruled considering the fact that his contribution to victory was marginal. for the madhya pradesh congress  more than the loss of scindia  the prospects of losing the government due to the desertion of the    odd legislators  including ministers  is a greater loss. kamal nath is likely to employ all the tricks in the political trade before giving up the fight  in which the apex leadership would in all likelihood be a mute spectator.also read  the many hurdles jyotiraditya scindia faces in bjp before he can fulfil his dreamsbad sportsmanshipjyotiraditya scindia lost his guna seat to his former personal assistant and  protege  by a margin of  .   lakh votes. the guna seat was won first by v.g. deshpande of the hindu maha sabha in       when the state was still called madhya bharat . jyotiraditya s grandmother  vijaya raje scindia  won it in                              and     . his father madhavrao scindia won the seat in                  and     . jyotiraditya scindia himself won the seat in                  and     .it is strange that he should feel that  serving the people cannot happen in this  congress  party .scindia lamented in his press conference in the bjp headquarters that the congress today is not what it used to be in the past. the reality is that he was one of the modern architects of that party. for him to slam the congress especially when it is down and out is bad sportsmanship  to say the least.also read  scindia in bjp  congress leaders can t do without power or gandhis failing to revive party the outsidersyet  scindia quitting the congress has to do more with the way the rahul gandhi sonia gandhi is behaving after two consecutive defeats in lok sabha elections. if media reports are to be believed  the top leadership under the firm grip of the gandhi family has no time for revamping the party and much less inclined to introspect successive defeats. in such a situation  political leaders with age on their side will naturally look for greener pastures. for the    year old third generation scindia  the bjp offers much more than what the congress can offer  for probably another two decades.for the bjp  it will be rather uncomfortable to absorb the fact that scindia could add value to the current cabinet and bring in fresh ideas. this would be seen as an adverse remark on the performance of the current lot of ministers under narendra modi and amit shah  most of whom have been with the bjp for more than three decades. another issue that the party will have to foresee is the possible restlessness among party loyalists and ideological torchbearers who could feel  ignored . while many of them would prefer to keep their reservations under wraps  the bjp s central leadership would do well to employ political semiosis to understand and rectify any grievances arising out of the lateral entry of non cadre popular  outsiders .the author is a member of the national executive committee of the bjp and former editor of organiser. views are personal.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews

haksar s advice to indira gandhi can help sonia steer congress in the right direction
text size  a  a it used to be said  in a quote attributed to everyone from woodrow wilson to henry kissinger  that academic politics are so vicious because the stakes are so low. but the same suddenly seems truer of politics in india. who would have thought that the grand old party would see so much conflict over the assignment of a handful of rajya sabha seats surrounded by the remnants of an old order  bowing and scraping  it might have escaped rahul gandhi s notice that time has passed. the only thing that is constant is change  and to adapt to that change  even belatedly  might be the only option. the point is to face the test of a lifetime  that of challenges within the party. an inter generational challenge  if some commentators are to be believed  of sonia gandhi and ahmed patel versus the not so young turks led by rahul gandhi. but more likely  of the nehru gandhi dynasty against a not so new crop of talent  patiently waiting in the wings in some cases  bursting at the seams in others.also read  talk point  what does nawaz sharif s disqualification mean for democracy in pakistan and its politicscomparing sonia with indirareading jairam ramesh s intertwined lives  pn haksar and indira gandhi is instructive  not least because it shows us how problems  never ending and sometimes seemingly intractable  were resolved deftly and quite often  graciously  in an earlier time. to equate indira gandhi s early years as prime minister with sonia gandhi s and briefly  rahul s tenures as congress presidents these last two decades may be construed as a case of glaringly false equivalence. but insofar as indira had a strong role in determining who was congress president when she was prime minister  and sonia gandhi has been congress president for much of the last two decades  the comparison holds value.in all of jairam ramesh s analyses of the big changes that principal private secretary p.n. haksar wrought  be it in bank nationalisation or the liberation of what would become bangladesh  it is the little details that reveal a more thoughtful leadership at the helm of congress s affairs. for instance  haksar emphasised that each member of the political affairs committee of the cabinet   jagjivan ram  y.b. chawan  sardar swaran singh  and fakhruddin ali ahmed   voice their views on the  aims and objectives of our negotiations with pakistan  before indira gandhi met with zulfiqar ali bhutto at the simla conference of     . the idea of collective responsibility meant speaking out  raising objections  and having them clarified  not hiding one s apprehensions and nodding along at the prime minister s proposals. it meant that the prime minister cared for  and be advised to care for  the counsel of her cabinet.the same held true for the opposition. when the young jana sangh leader atal bihari vajpayee attacked the indian government for not being critical enough of the soviet union s decision to supply pakistan with arms  haksar urged indira gandhi to meet with him privately  explain the intricacies of the indo soviet relationship  and  leave a line of retreat for him .in a similar vein  haksar insisted that indira gandhi reassure academic heavyweights taking on new tasks that she would personally support them in their new roles as administrative leaders. this included satish dhawan  successor to vikram sarabhai as chairman of the indian space research organisation as well as v. radhakrishnan who came back from australia to head the raman research institute. haksar knew they were nervous in their new roles and needed a bit of handholding  she  in turn  accepted his advice.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowyet  what is remarkable is how  in the eventful years that he served indira gandhi  haksar was also blunt with his boss. this meant writing to her that it was  unrealistic  and  lacking in seriousness  for her to suggest that india approach china for a treaty of friendship shortly after they had signed one with the soviet union  and then proceeding to give the prime minister an extended lesson in diplomacy. at this time  india and china had yet to resume a normal ambassadorial relationship so it was far fetched to think in terms of a special treaty of friendship and cooperation. at another point  it meant admonishing her so that she was forced to establish a protocol for diplomats and others seeking appointments with her. it meant  in short  taking their jobs seriously  being professional at all times.also read  why modi is using nehru to try and demolish the gandhi dynasty and congressthe long wait to meet the high commandfast forward to the present  what would haksar make of very senior  and some not so senior  leaders being asked to wait for months to meet with the  high command   or put on hold on the telephone time and again  haksar would have been characteristically blunt  and  in the less forgiving years that were to come  it cost him his job. the second half of jairam ramesh s biography covers the years haksar worked hard  but not in the glow of the prime minister s secretariat. we see haksar being sidelined  and  at the same time  the slow unraveling of indira gandhi s carefully constructed power in a less confident time. that the family in the shape of sanjay gandhi played a massive role in creating this less confident time hardly needs to be reiterated.what does it mean to hold power  electoral power  political power today  to be among the     most powerful people in india or among the     most powerful women in the world  the power of leading an election rally  the rush of hearing your name on loudspeakers  seeing your name emblazoned on banners  posters  hoardings. the power to nominate candidates  build a political career  bring down a political career. the power to give darshan  to refuse to give darshan  to take a phone call  to refuse to take a phone call. the sense to use power responsibly and carefully  the incredible and appalling lack of sense  the thoughtlessness of tearing up an ordinance with all the media in attendance.a recent article by senior congress leaders sanjay jha and salman soz suggests that there is a widely felt need within the congress for  a formal shadow cabinet   the inclusion of  outstanding talent  whose  collective brilliance remains untapped  and the need to nurture and build  a surfeit of independent state leaders.  the congress has its strengths  for the  high command  to fear rival sources of power is not a sign of internal party democracy  but more in keeping with putin s russia. a wishy washy  half time leader isn t the kind aspirational india needs or can look up to. the congress  if it wishes to make a comeback  will have to push to positions of leadership professional  committed  worthy politicians  not part time dynasts.neeti nair is associate professor of history at the university of virginia and global fellow at the woodrow wilson international center for scholars. views are

how jyotiraditya scindia s departure shows congress is an hr disaster
text size  a  a new delhi  three of bjp s senior most leaders who were sworn in as cabinet ministers after the      general elections have been party presidents   amit shah  rajnath singh and nitin gadkari.what this shows is that each leader has come from below to compete and fight in order to become party president at a young age and then become senior ministers.prime minister narendra modi too fought his way to the top  though he did not become party president.congress  by comparison  is an hr disaster. this is why.the congress in crisiswhile the bjp prepared   on the eve of jyotiraditya scindia s departure from the congress   by having a meeting with its senior members  the congress  leaders were nowhere to be seen.unlike the bjp  the congress has one leader and no hierarchy.in hr  there is the concept of a glass ceiling. if you grow in an organisation  and if people sitting at the top continue to grow  the glass ceiling for everybody else is lifted higher.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowsimply put  the congress is failing both these tests   it is declining and not growing. the party leaders themselves are not trying to raise the ceiling.rahul gandhi took too long to take on the party presidentship. until he became president  all others in the party had to be below that level.similarly  he did not take a ministry. if he had taken a junior ministry in upa   and a senior ministry in upa    he would have proven his mettle. but because he hasn t grown  others couldn t grow either.when you have options  you leave. that s precisely what jyotiraditya did.dynasties in the congressapart from the scindias  there are several dynasties within the congress such as the shastris  jagjivan ram  digvijay singh and his son  kamal nath and his son  rajesh pilot and his son  ashok ghelot  arjun singh and his son  and p. chidambaram s son.not everyone is patient enough to wait around. there are several who have left before scindia   sharad pawar  who formed his own party  the ncp   purna sangma  who did the same as narayan rane  who joined the bjp.most notably  jagan mohan reddy left though his father  y.s. rajasekhara reddy  founded the congress in andhra pradesh. after his father died  jagan mohan had approached the party leaders asking to take over his father s mantle.but the congress responded with resentment  which led him to quit. he spent over a year in jail  worked hard  and took away the congress  vote in andhra pradesh.is congress a meritocracy everyone calls rahul gandhi a failure with no political achievements  but that isn t necessarily true. first is  under him  the party won    seats in uttar pradesh. the second is when the party came close to defeating the bjp in gujarat in     .but do we remember anyone he has given credit to for their performances in uttar pradesh and gujarat  the short answer is no.in rajasthan  for example  ghelot was given chief ministership over sachin pilot  even though pilot worked to give the party power.when the glass ceiling is lowered  it s a matter of time before dying.you can watch the full episode of ctc here.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis   only you can fix it you are reading this because you value good  intelligent and objective journalism. we thank you for your time and your trust. you also know that the news media is facing an unprecedented crisis. it is likely that you are also hearing of the brutal layoffs and pay cuts hitting the industry. there are many reasons why the media s economics is broken. but a big one is that good people are not yet paying enough for good journalism. we have a newsroom filled with talented young reporters. we also have the country s most robust editing and fact checking team  finest news photographers and video professionals. we are building india s most ambitious and energetic news platform. and we aren t even three yet. at theprint  we invest in quality journalists. we pay them fairly and on time even in this difficult period. as you may have noticed  we do not flinch from spending whatever it takes to make sure our reporters reach where the story is. our stellar coronavirus coverage is a good example. you can check some of it here. this comes with a sizable cost. for us to continue bringing quality journalism  we need readers like you to pay for it. because the advertising market is broken too. if you think we deserve your support  do join us in this endeavour to strengthen fair  free  courageous  and questioning journalism  please click on the link below. your support will define our journalism  and theprint s future. it will take just a few seconds of your time. support our journalismshow full article

been an mla from gwalior since     .while the nehru gandhi dynasty is in decline  the services of this one are split between the congress and the bjp. jyotiraditya s exit from the congress makes it the first time since      that both streams of the dynasty will come into the same fold.why this has happened with congresscompared to this father  jyotiraditya was not able to secure the same roles and responsibilities at the same age. he was made a minister of state only in the upa   regime  and not of a significant ministry.even though he is nearing     he is still considered a  youngster  by the congress  and feels there is no future in the party.it reflects a strange mindset on the part of congress  which says   don t tell us what you ve done  you are what you are because of us .several young congressmen have had the same complaint   jagan mohan reddy suffered first  then came the turn of himanta biswa sharma.under sonia and rahul  the congress has reversed indira gandhi s playbook of       when she split the congress into congress  indira  and congress  organisation . she took with her the younger talented people   though most of them turned against her later   leaving behind the older members.now  younger talent is leaving the party  and older people are staying on.where does the congress go from here the congress has a peculiar quality   once it loses power comprehensively in a state it doesn t come back. strong leaders like mamata banerjee in west bengal  jagan mohan reddy in andhra pradesh  and k. chandrasekhar rao in telangana have taken power where congress once ruled.there is a strong possibility that madhya pradesh will go that way. in other words  the vote that was loyal to the congress party will now go to somebody else.you can watch the

one dynasty dimming  we said of the gandhis   congress
text size  a  a i had framed the following questions in a    february       national interest  headlined  one dynasty dimming. what has changed fundamentally in politics over the past decade  or what hasn t  or  what is it that has changed radically and dramatically  and yet looks like the continuation of an old  familiar pattern my answer then to this muddled question was  dynastic politics. we can ask the very same questions again. the answer will also be the same.put more simply  dynastic politics is now on the decline  yet the phenomenon has acquired deeper roots. dynasties of the congress and other bjp rivals have been wiped out in these elections  but the bjp s are thriving. we are dealing with a paradox where dynastic hold on india s politics has declined and grown at the same time.the predictable counter to this  how can you say dynasties are outdated when jyotiraditya could soon be the fifth from his family to be holding a formal position in the bjp  in fact  if he goes there  he will be a third generation dynast there  after grandmother rajmata vijayaraje and aunts vasundhara and yashodhara  along with cousin dushyant  also an mp. but this is a subsuming of identity  or a leveraged buyout merger  more than rebuilding of a dynasty.this cannot fight the fact that conflicting political cross currents have brought about a fundamental shift. they have hurt the congress most of all. you could have asked any congress leader      onwards   leaders who contest elections  unlike its star cast of chronic rajya sabha ists    and they will admit to you  albeit in whispers and fearfully glancing left and right  that the days when the gandhi family could win them their seats are over. in the elections  now  it has been every man for himself for nearly a decade. so those who nurse their constituencies  or have local  caste based or family vote banks  win their seats. of course  it helps if the gandhis visit to campaign as it endorses them within the party. but beyond that  their ability to win seats beyond the amethi rae bareli enclave has diminished to insignificance. even amethi has pulled away this time.i had then asked a senior  and always elected  congress leader  then why was the gandhi family still so important and had total sway over the party  he said  surely they cannot help anyone win elections  but they keep the party together. their word is law and the party needs that discipline. illustration  the moment sonia or rahul say something  everyone nods and falls in line. if narasimha rao or sitaram kesri said something  everyone broke out in rebellion.also read  how bjp tapped jyotiraditya scindia s isolation in congress to make him quit the partywe are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowyou could assess rahul s debut speech accepting the top party post in jaipur in      in this perspective. it tugged immediately at fellow party workers  heartstrings  but made little impact beyond. so  here is the answer to the first half of our question  the dynasty has become even stronger within the congress  with not even a whiff of discontent of the kind nehru  occasionally   indira  twice and substantively so  and rajiv  most significant of all  faced. from      onwards  the dynasty has owned the party as never before. but its pan national vote catching appeal is history.one reason the gandhi family has lost its pan national appeal is because several new dynasties   at least    of them politically significant   have risen in key electoral zones of india. each one of these now has a strong  proprietary votebank and total ownership of its party. a pan national dynasty no longer has the ability to breach these fortresses. from the abdullahs in kashmir  badals in punjab  mulayam singh in uttar pradesh  chandrababu naidu and jagan mohan reddy in andhra pradesh  karunanidhi in tamil nadu  gowdas in karnataka  the thackerays and pawars in maharashtra  lalu in bihar to naveen patnaik in odisha and the sangmas in distant meghalaya  all represent dynasties that may be limited by geography but cannot be challenged by a national party. so  a lalu may be thrashed by a nitish  but his vote share will still remain ahead of the congress  or even the bjp  particularly if the party was out of its alliance with the jd u .the inability to counter  or now challenge  the rise of these dynasties is the congress party s biggest failure. it has also  therefore  become the greatest game changer in our politics. each one of these dynasties is represented by a strong local leader who has tasted and exercised elected power. each one has learnt the art of leveraging his regional power to grab a share of the national pie. they have also learnt that real clout  and money  is now in the states. this was explained to me most honestly by h.d. kumaraswamy  deve gowda s son  when he was briefly chief minister of karnataka.  my father   he said   committed a great mistake in becoming prime minister of india.  in return for that job for a few months  he said  his father lost control over the state of karnataka.  we all have to learn from the dmk   he said.  keep your hold in your own state  and then negotiate with whoever leads the coalition in delhi for a share of national power.  the gandhis haven t found an answer to this. nor can they complain about it  because they were the ones who established the principle of a political party as a closely held family concern.in fact  so lazy has the congress leadership been with its politics that while its own vote base has been taken away by these satrap families  a number of mini or sub dynasties have risen within the party. partly because that s where the leadership s comfort level is  isn t it so much easier to deal with familiar faces  to be among your  own   generation to generation  and partly because the party had no other mechanism to produce new crops of leaders from student  trade union or even tribal or farmers  movements  the traditional nurseries of indian political talent. so  the party now has amarinder singh  wife and son etc in punjab  the hoodas in haryana  where kiran chaudhary represents the bansi lal lineage as well  sheila dikshit and son in delhi  virbhadra singh in himachal  sachin pilot  jitin prasada  milind deora  all of whom represent sub dynasties and are mostly capable of winning their own seats. you can go on counting  from narayan rane in maharashtra to even pranab mukherjee and son in west bengal. the congress owns them all  but is no longer capable of challenging them or holding them together. it tried to defy one such  in fact the most prominent of these  and ended up creating the political disaster called andhra pradesh. add to that  subsequently  assam and madhya pradesh.this is the central problem with the party  its top leadership can no longer win national elections. its efforts to rekindle the gandhi nehru family nostalgia cannot go beyond the party faithful today. and it has no regional leaders to counter these    odd regional dynasts. its own group of political scions is like a chamber of princes. they have failed to extend their influence beyond their own constituencies. the party s politics is trapped now in this rut. and you cannot pull it out of this simply by invoking the name of the family  even five generations of it. this just won t do in the india of       three decades after indira gandhi s assassination.an earlier version of this article was published on    february     .also read  jyotiraditya scindia quits congress  can t serve people

arvind kejriwal risks becoming rajiv gandhi  neither here nor there
text size  a  a the communal violence in northeast delhi was of such a large scale that the death toll keeps rising from the hospital beds or with the recovery of unidentified bodies  days after the violence has subsided. rumour mongering has kept much of delhi on edge. the man who incited the riots to begin with  bjp leader kapil mishra  has been leading peace marches. a judge who wanted prompt action was quickly transferred.yet  the public anger has been directed not just at the central government but also at the delhi state government. the arvind kejriwal led aam aadmi party  aap  comes across as not having done much in the last one week. it has been largely absent  doing formalities so that no one can say what it did   or didn t do.aap members say it s unfair to blame cm kejriwal because the delhi police does not report to his government. but the aap is not just a party in power. it was meant to be a people s movement  many years ago. what the aap needed to do most was speak loudly against the injustice of the bjp leadership and the delhi police. the aap is not giving political voice to the people.but the question is  which people also read  how arvind kejriwal s third attempt at national politics may play outhave the cake and eat it toowe saw recently in the delhi assembly election that the aap wants the votes of both shaheen bagh going muslims as well as of hindus who vote for narendra modi in the lok sabha. that s like wanting to have your cake and eat it too   kejriwal enjoyed such an impossibility in two assembly elections       and     .but the war zone of northeast delhi threatens to neither let kejriwal have his cake nor eat it.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowafter aap corporator tahir hussain was accused of storing petrol bombs on the roof of his house  the bjp and its proxies went into overdrive  accusing the aap of having masterminded the violence. soon thereafter  the aap government signed the file that allowed prosecution of kanhaiya kumar  anirban bhattacharya and umar khalid in a  completely fraudulent  sedition case.this suggests that the aap was so rattled by the tahir hussain issue that it needed to show to the bjp voter it is not an extreme left party. hence the kanhaiya card. this balancing act is reminiscent of rajiv gandhi  who thought he could keep both muslims and hindus happy. he ended up making both unhappy. the modi voter will blame the aap for tahir hussain  regardless of the truth about his role  which we don t fully know   and the muslim voter will blame the aap for not standing up to the bjp.the aap thinks that only the noisy left and liberals care about kanhaiya  and only they think the aap has intentionally abdicated responsibility in the delhi riots. this is similar to how the aap doesn t go beyond lip service on air pollution because it thinks only twitter activists care.also read  no soft hindutva  no left revolution  kejriwal establishing a new centre in indian politicsneither secular nor commnunalthis time the aap could be wrong. the perception of the aap and the delhi government abdicating responsibility in northeast delhi could hurt them in the long run   in both delhi and nationally. right now  their calculation is that delhi s muslim voters have no option  and an election is not around the corner anyway. so  they have time to repair the damage. in other words  they are taking muslim voters for granted just like  secular  parties are accused of doing.both muslims and hindus have died and suffered in northeast delhi. other than muslims  the aap is also wont to ignore this area adjoining uttar pradesh from where it doesn t get too many votes. this should open the doors for a congress revival in delhi  but of course it is absent too.the aap even now is not doing enough in the riot affected areas. it has been slow in setting up relief camps. its mlas and workers on the ground are not found holding hands of victims  helping the needy get aid in time. they have their answers and excuses for this  they say they have been doing things they are not getting credit for. getting a big relief camp up and running when the delhi police was not assuring security  for example  was not feasible.it comes back to optics  then. and the aap is particular that it does not want to be seen as either  secular  or  communal . it also does not want to be seen as being confrontational with the modi government  because the latter can completely squeeze its functioning. we saw what happened around      when kejriwal went all out against modi. they don t want to do dharna politics anymore.so  what do they want to do  stick to the mandate and powers of the delhi government  clip its political wings as if politics is limited to free electricity. with such an approach of conflict avoidance  the aap could be shrinking its own political space  in delhi and nationally.the author is contributing editor to theprint. views are personal.subscribe to our channels

how bjp s one party dominance differs from congress  it co opts local elites and opponents
text size  a  a the overwhelming victory of the bharatiya janata party in two consecutive lok sabha elections has heralded india into a new era. some observers describe this emerging pattern of competition as the second phase of one party dominance  the first one referring to the period of congress domination over national and state politics in the     s and     s.the current configuration  however  is of a slightly different nature because of how it is setting up a new political culture   not just by co opting civil society groups and local elites but also its opponents.the fundamental characteristic of a single dominant party is that it is  centripetal   meaning it draws all elements of civil society into its ambit. the politics is structured in a way that allows the dominant party s organisation to penetrate into all elements of society  which manifests itself in the ideological centrality and electoral superiority of the party.in the indian context  the bharatiya janata party  bjp  has sought to centralise political power in its national unit  through the charismatic authority of narendra modi.the party also has developed a significant resource advantage in terms of campaign finance and driving media narrative. this has coincided with the bjp led government unabashedly promoting an ideological agenda that will re define majority minority relations on the ground  re ignite the debate on citizenship norms  dramatically alter the federal balance of power  and construct a new political culture.also read  the new voters for modi s bjp are poorer  more majoritarian but not as religiousideological centralitythe bjp within the six months of coming back to power has pushed legislations to realise some of its long standing projects such as the abrogation of jammu and kashmir s special status through article      the construction of a ram temple in ayodhya  the implementation of national register of citizens  nrc  and of the citizenship amendment act  caa . despite serious setbacks in recent state elections  these policy decisions retain a high level of popular support  to the point that even the opposition seems to be mirroring its ideas and tactics.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowdata suggests that a larger proportion of citizens are now identifying with the bjp. the centre for the study of developing societies  csds  lokniti surveys have asked respondents to identify which political party  if any  they feel close to. the proportion of respondents who identify with any political party has mostly remained the same across the five decades beginning        approximately one third of the indian electorate. however  there has been a sea change in their partisan preference  figure   .figure    identification with the bjp has increasedin       an overwhelming number of those who felt close to a party picked the congress  almost    per cent . by       the bjp and the congress had similar levels of support from partisans  those who feel close to any party   about    per cent each. in       the bjp had more than twice as many partisans identifying with it     per cent  than the congress     per cent . as an analytical concept  the importance of party identification lies in the fact that it is relatively exogenous to the more specific short term factors and provides a stable basis of support for a party. they make for a party s core support base and give it a mainstay on which to mobilise new voters.also read  four reasons why bjp is losing to congress and regional parties in assembly electionsdisjuncture between state and national electionsone of the more curious aspects of the current party system is that the electoral dominance at the national level does not extend to the state level. if anything  the recent trend has been for the bjp to lose the election  or at least a significant vote share  in states in which it performed well in the national election. in delhi  haryana  and jharkhand assembly elections  all of which took place within a year of the bjp s      lok sabha election triumph   the bjp lost at least    percentage points in vote share as compared to its national performance.nowhere is this disjuncture more evident than the electoral behavior of odisha   which held its assembly election simultaneously with the national election. this means that voters cast two ballots   for state  and national level leaders. of odisha s    lok sabha  national  seats  the bjp won eight with an average seat wise vote share of    per cent in     . going by its    per cent average seat wise vote share in the assembly  state  election  the bjp would have won none of odisha s    lok sabha seats.but this too is a manifestation of the centralisation of power as well as campaign resources in the bjp s national unit. in a bid to make sure that narendra modi remains its most popular leader  and reduce factional feuds in the party  the current avatar of the bjp has weakened the position of its own regional leaders. this state of affairs simultaneously puts the bjp at an electoral advantage in national elections and at a disadvantage in state elections. if the bjp continues to remain dominant nationally  ascribing more power to the central leadership is likely to weaken india s federal bargain.also read  a chaiwala is pm  but it s the cartel of power elites that calls the shots in indiathe changing social bases of politicssince       the rise of the bjp has been associated with an upsurge of representation of traditional elite groups  namely the upper castes  across the hindi belt. in several important states such as uttar pradesh or bihar  upper caste representation has gone back to pre mandal levels  around    per cent of the seats and between       per cent of all the bjp s elected representatives. other backward classes  obc  representation  which rose significantly during the     s  has either plateaued or decreased in most north indian states  around    per cent. most chief ministers appointed by the bjp since      belong to the upper castes  who are also over represented in regional cabinets.the data  however  indicates that the upsurge of traditional elite representation precedes the rise of the bjp  figure   . in the hindi belt  upper caste representation in the lok sabha jumped by    per cent between      and       to    per cent of all mps from those states. an examination of the caste composition of all major parties shows that  by and large  upper castes have regained their lost political strength in elected assemblies by virtue of being co opted by most parties   if not all   including by the regional parties that initially rose in opposition to the traditional social and political order.figure    caste and community representation in the hindi belt            over the past few decades  parties that used to mobilise a core electorate defined narrowly in specific caste terms have been incentivised to build up more inclusive platforms and seek to appeal to a larger array of groups  by offering them representation. this has essentially meant that most parties tend to recruit their candidates from the same sociological pool of local elites. the bjp offers much continuity in that regard and has succeeded in combining the elite co optation strategy that used to work for its adversaries with its encompassing hindutva project. by reconciliating mandal and mandir  the bjp has  in effect  enhanced the elitist character of india s political class.in the past two decades  indian politics has been undergoing a significant transition  which includes rapid changes in the demographic composition of indian electorate  for example  more middle class  and voters  for example  more women turning out   alongside advancement in information and communication technology  which meant a larger population now consumes mass media.the full impacts of these changes are yet to be known. nonetheless  recruitment patterns within political parties  nomination criteria  and campaign strategies  among other indicators of electoral contests are undergoing a visible reorganization. this rearrangement of forces  along with the bjp as a system defining party  is likely to generate long lasting social and political transformations in indian society.rahul verma is a fellow at the centre for policy research  cpr

if rahul gandhi stays out  congress must find an active  full time leader  shashi tharoor
text size  a  a my recently renewed calls for the indian national congress to take steps to revive its leadership have stirred some disquiet. well meaning friends have told me that i am liable to be misunderstood  that by saying out loud what so many have been whispering privately  i would leave myself open to charges of disloyalty.but it is out of the greatest loyalty to the ideals and values of the congress party that i have spoken up. i am not a lifetime politician  i do not think like a careerist  anxious above all to avoid rocking the boat. i am in politics because i hold a set of convictions i believe are necessary for india to advance  and i support the congress because its history  its experience  and the talent available to it make it the best vehicle to advance the inclusive values and pluralist principles i hold dear.yet  the recent results of the delhi assembly election  where the congress again drew a blank  undermine that claim. after placing fourth in maharashtra  being accused of not trying hard enough in haryana  and losing karnataka so soon after forming a government there  delhi offers the most recent case for the congress to urgently address key concerns that are hampering our effectiveness as a pan national political alternative to the bharatiya janata party  bjp . at a time when we should be consolidating ourselves as the obvious answer to the increasingly discredited bjp  to score   per cent of the vote in the national capital is worse than a defeat  it is an embarrassment. worse  it feeds into the increased public perception  fuelled by a dismissive media  that the congress is adrift and rudderless  incapable of taking up the challenge of a credible national opposition.also read  from catch all to catch none party  it s still not too late for congressan endless limboas a student of the party s proud history in the vanguard of the national movement  as an admirer of the great leaders it gave to the nation  and as a foot soldier of the party who has propagated its values in books  articles and speeches around the country  i do not want to see the congress reduced to a term of derision. in my view  the congress is indispensable to the future of india. it offers an alternative unifying vision to the divisive and exclusionary ideology of the current ruling dispensation that has fractured our society through their politics of polarisation and driven our economy to the ground. the congress alone has the vision  the capability and the nationwide footprint to champion the dreams and aspirations of the people of india.but for us to do that  we need to actively work to change the existing perception about the congress. when  following the      lok sabha election  rahul gandhi offered his resignation as the party s president to take accountability for our stinging defeat  i was one of many who tried to talk him out of it. first  because the collective outcome demanded collective responsibility  but equally because of the firm belief among congress workers that he has the capacity and vision to rally the party together and take it forward on an immediate process of revival. at the end of the day  he stuck to his decision and we must respect that. many believe that the current sense of drift is because the party establishment is waiting indefinitely for him to change his mind. if true  is that fair   to him or to the party of course  if rahul does agree to reinstatement  then the sooner he does so the better  and the party will welcome it. but if he persists in his determination to decline the office  we need to find an active and full time leadership so the party can move forward as the nation expects. as i said in my interview to the pti sunday  the working committee has for now found an excellent interim solution in the redoubtable sonia gandhi  but it is increasingly becoming clear that we cannot indefinitely keep depending on  and burdening  a president who had only just relinquished the job less than two years ago. it is not fair to her  and not fair to the voters.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowalso read  why rahul gandhi remains india s third most important politicianevolving with the timesthe longer the congress waits to get its act together  the greater the risk of a steady erosion of our traditional vote bank and their gravitation towards our political competitors. this is why i suggested that electing a new congress president  as well as members of the working committee  is imperative. i have personally been an outspoken advocate for free and transparent elections within the party for these positions because a leader elected by the party workers will have a great advantage in addressing organisational challenges as well as the process of rebuilding that is required to internally strengthen the rank and file of the party. a president appointed by the  high command  would lack the same legitimacy.as a democrat  i believe the value of a truly representative body within the congress is immeasurable. to begin with  it would energise the workers and give them a sense that they are in control of the party s political destiny. to those who claim it would divide the party  i respectfully argue that a participatory electoral process  channelling the wishes of the members of the aicc plus pcc delegates   some        workers in all   is an exercise in inner party democracy that will strengthen the party. it will usher in a popular leadership team with a credible mandate to work dynamically to address the party s organisational challenges. and ultimately  we need to recognise that the congress needs to evolve with the times  and a process of revival also means a process of bringing in new ideas and fresh faces that can offer solutions to today s challenges.also read  bjp   media s continuing obsession with rahul gandhi only shows that he is still relevantbuilding on some positivesthe new leadership team would have the

authoritatively. it would start the revival of the congress in states  especially strengthening the grassroots structures  which have atrophied in many places. where necessary  it would explore pragmatic coalitions so as not to divide the anti government vote  including promoting the possibility of an opposition front in parliament  which we need not be the convenors of  if a smaller party

why rahul gandhi  kejriwal  yechury  mayawati and prashant kishor all love to hate rss
text size  a  a imagine a janeudhari bengali with a trident shaped red tika offering prayers at a kolkata temple and then heading straight to buy  hold your breath  karl marx s communist manifesto and che guevara s the motorcycle diaries from a book shop run by comrades.he would probably end up buying thomas more s utopia for that s where today s communists seem to live nowadays. the communist party of india  marxist  s latest internal review document speaks of installing  permanent book shops  medical centres and water facilities  in temple premises.as the comrades also wish to install  secular minded believers  in the temple management  one can only guess how they would indoctrinate them with a little help from marx in whose words   religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature  the heart of a heartless world  and the soul of the soulless conditions. it s the opium of the people . there are reams of writing on marx s understanding of religion  but indian communists have always been ambivalent about this. while many saw atheism as a basic tenet of their ideology  others would argue that marx didn t see religion as a disease but as its manifestation. remember late subhas chakraborty  the former west bengal transport minister  every time his temple visit would stir controversy  he would say   i am first a hindu and then a brahmin how can i deny it  anyway  the cpi m  doesn t bar believers from becoming a member.what is more interesting in the cpi m  document is the reason cited by the party   we cannot leave the temples and other religious places to the mercy of the rss and its various outfits.  haven t you heard it before if there is one factor that unites the opposition in india today apart from power  of course it s the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh  rss  or their contempt for it.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support

banerjee or sitaram yechury  nitish kumar or lalu tejashwi yadav  anti rssism dominates their politics. rahul gandhi is ready to go to jail  but he won t apologise for his allegedly defamatory remarks against the sangh.the bhim army of chandrashekhar azad was gloating over the fact that he hoisted the tricolour near the rss headquarters in nagpur on saturday.  manuvaad will end only with a ban on the rss   azad said there.even the ambitious poll strategist  prashant kishor  launched his debut as an aspiring opposition politician in bihar with a godse versus gandhi jibe against nitish kumar. it was a bit rich for the former health expert who had closely worked with narendra modi s bjp   and rss functionaries   in gujarat elections as also in the      lok sabha elections. that was before his fallout with amit shah  which forced him to seek his fortune in the opposition camp.so  why do opposition politicians love to hate the rss  first  it sustains their delusion or what they would have people believe   that it s not prime minister narendra modi but the rss that is keeping the bjp in power. it s their way of denying modi s mass appeal and their own failures. as if he would be a rahul gandhi without the rss.of course  the rss has been the ideological factory and assembly line for regular production of jana sangh bjp leaders. its socio cultural activities in far flung areas of india also lay the ground for the bjp s expansion. the rss imprint on the modi government is unmistakable today  with a former pracharak as the prime minister of the country.also read  prashant kishor is seen as an election magician. but he wins only when in winning teamthe wrong treeyet  the opposition leaders are barking up the wrong tree with their constant attacks on the rss for its alleged involvement in fomenting communal riots and for its stated goal of a hindu rashtra. if these leaders were to hold a survey on how many votes these attacks fetched for them  they would get a rude jolt. if at all  they have ensured a more curious audience for the sangh.the so called fight to protect the  spirit  of india from what opposition leaders call a hindu supremacist ideology fails to hide their weakness and inability to counter the rss. the hindustani seva mandal  the precursor of the congress party s seva dal  came into existence in       a year before the founding of the rss. the seva dal exists today  but only in name  thanks to the congress leadership s lack of interest.the communists in bengal seek to blame the rss for their plight but the latter was irrelevant in the state when mamata banerjee dislodged them from power in     . if dalits are abandoning mayawati and theyadavs are leaving akhilesh and tejashwi yadav  it s not because of the rss  influence  it s because they are no longer happy being mere instruments of power and comforts for individual leaders.also read  why and how ideology is central to winning elections in indialook in the mirrorhowever much opposition leaders might demonise the rss and blame its communal ideology for the rise of leaders such as narendra modi  the fact is that they can t blame the sangh for losing their own political credibility and mass appeal. as it is  it s the rss that depends on modi for its expansion today and not vice versa.in       during his visit to the us  jawaharlal nehru had given a talk to then us president dwight eisenhower  telling him how communism had the seeds of destruction in itself and the us president shouldn t worry about it. nehru was proved right decades later. the rss is not a big fan of nehru. nor does it see any such seeds in its ideology so far  i guess.for now  before heading to temples  the comrades may like to try selling the communist manifesto at sites where the rss has the least influence probably at shaheen bagh  to start with.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis   only you can fix it you are reading this because you value good

jamia isn t anti national  gandhi wanted to help raise funds with a  begging bowl 
text size  a  a jamia millia islamia has been in the news during the past few weeks because of the participation of its students in the anti caa agitation and the alleged excesses committed by the delhi police against them. the prevailing perception in some quarters that the anti caa protests at jamia were a part of a nefarious  islamic  conspiracy undertaken at a predominantly muslim institution to create mayhem in the country is the result of total ignorance of the history of jamia and its ideological moorings.some of this ignorance is based on the misunderstanding that jamia was founded primarily to impart religious education and that the secular curriculum is a mere add on or fa ade to hide its true character. nothing can be farther from the truth.jamia was founded not to impart islamic education but modern education to muslim youth while at the same time inculcating a sense of indian nationalism within them. this is a very important distinction. jamia was not and is not a religious seminary like deoband  although the latter also has a hoary nationalist past and leading luminaries of the seminary have participated in the freedom movement and opposed the partition of the country.also read  have lost one eye  not resolve  jamia student who won best paper after police lathi chargejamia and its objectivein terms of its basic educational purpose  jamia is like the aligarh muslim university  amu  and was its offshoot. however  the ideological foundations and the political trajectories of the two institutions in the pre independence period were polar opposites of each other. amu was the brainchild of sir syed ahmad khan whose primary goal was to prepare young muslims from ashraf families through the medium of modern education to improve their status in british ruled india. jamia  on the other hand  was founded by a group of nationalist teachers  alumni  and students who quit amu in response to mahatma gandhi s call to boycott all educational institutions supported or run by the colonial regime. they were especially protesting against amu s decision to bar students and teachers from participating in the non cooperation and khilafat movements.prominent members of the movement to set up a nationalist  muslim counterpart to british supported amu were maulana mahmud hasan  maulana muhammad ali  hakim ajmal khan  dr. mukhtar ahmad ansari  and abdul majid khwaja  several of whom were leading lights of the congress. in the words of poet activist sarojini naidu  they  built up the jamia millia stone by stone and sacrifice by sacrifice . rabindranath tagore called it  one of the most progressive educational institutions of india . the second wave of muslim scholars  including zakir hussein  who later became president of india  who were studying abroad gave up the idea of lucrative careers and decided to join the jamia faculty. zakir hussein accepted a monthly salary of one hundred rupees  which he voluntarily reduced to eighty rupees when jamia was faced with a financial crunch in     . it is reported that when jamia faced severe financial problems  mahatma gandhi boosted the morale of its founders by declaring   jamia has to run. if you are worried about its finances  i will go about with a begging bowl .also read  jamia saga   abp has   videos  times now has   while zee news has shocking headlinewe are deeply grateful

nowan institution for  co existence jamia moved from aligarh to delhi in      first to karol bagh and then in      to its present location in okhla  then a sleepy village on the outskirts of delhi. from its very inception  jamia has stood for the co existence of islamic values with secular nationalism. its founders believed that it was possible to be a patriot while being a good muslim. to them  islam and indian nationalism were two sides of the same coin and one was incomplete without the other. one of its founders maulana hussain ahmad madani  who later became the head of the deoband seminary  wrote a book titled  composite nationalism  advocating this thesis. the combination of two words  millia   meaning  national   and  islamia   meaning islamic  demonstrates the fusion of secular nationalism and muslim identity  both essential components of jamia s ideology.the raison d etre of jamia was to build an educational institution and simultaneously provide a public space where muslims could proudly be both indian and muslim  thus defying the british policy of dividing indians by religious affiliation. it distinguished itself from amu on two counts. one  it refused to take any financial help from the government as long as the british ruled india. two  jamia rejected jinnah s pernicious two nation theory that gained a great deal of support at amu in the     s. even at the time of partition when communal killings were taking place around the city  the jamia campus continued to be a haven of peace refusing to be engulfed by the madness surrounding it. its students and teachers worked with muslims who had been displaced by the riots and taken refuge at humayun s tomb and purana qila. at the same time  the jamia campus gave shelter to hindu and sikh refugees uprooted from their homes in what had become pakistan.one should view the jamia student s opposition to  and protest against  caa nrc in the context of the institution s ideological underpinnings into which they have been socialized. whether rightly or wrongly  many students of jamia  both muslim and hindu  saw the caa as derogating from the idea of composite nationalism which has formed the bedrock of jamia s existence. it is important to understand that their opposition to caa is not based either on islamic revivalism or on any political ideology threatening the unity of the nation but exactly the reverse.the author is university distinguished professor emeritus of international relations  michigan state university. views are personal.subscribe to our channels on youtube

opposition unity in bihar is being tested by congress  new love for kanhaiya kumar
text size  a  a with about eight months to go for the bihar assembly election  the political circles in the state are jostling to figure out the name of the challenger to chief minister nitish kumar. bihar s opposition parties are similarly locked in a quarrel and are yet to decide on their chief ministerial candidate.rashtriya janata dal  rjd   the biggest party in bihar s grand alliance or mahagathbandhan  has declared tejashwi yadav as its candidate. but there s a reason why the congress  the second major party in the alliance  hasn t come on board yet.the cm facecongress wants the co ordination committee of the mahagathbandhan to decide on the cm name. so do other parties in the opposition camp  like hindustani awam morcha  ham   rashtriya lok samta party  rlsp  and vikaassheel insan party  vip .for the left parties  there is no confusion  kanhaiya kumar is their leader.on the face of it  lalu yadav s youngest son tejaswi yadav is the face of opposition in bihar. he is their leader in bihar assembly  although that is mainly because he heads the largest party in the alliance.but if a meeting of the co ordination committee is all it will take to end the quarrel  why hasn t tejashwi yadav convened one also read  the nitish formula kanhaiya  tejashwi  chirag are using to build support before bihar pollswe are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowthe kanhaiya factorpeople aware of the developments say tejashwi yadav is fearful of the communist party of india  cpi  leader kanhaiya kumar. tejashwi s fear is more pronounced these days because the former president of jnu students  union is travelling all over bihar and his rallies are drawing massive crowds.it s the same story from the      lok sabha election playing out months before the bihar assembly election  scheduled for october november this year. despite the left s insistence  the rjd nominated its candidate tanveer hasan from begusarai parliamentary seat. it was said at the time that the party s decision was prompted by a similar fear in tejashwi camp over the kanhaiya factor.the only difference this time is that the congress is also tilting towards kanhaiya kumar. bihar congress leader and mla from katihar district s kadwa constituency  shakeel ahmad khan  who is considered a think tank in his own right  has stood solidly behind kanhaiya kumar.a rally of the cpi leader makes it clear that while he is the sole face being projected  the one in charge of making that happen is shakeel ahmad khan. and if it s a rally of kanhaiya kumar  surely it will have the supporters and members of the left parties.so  is there a left congress bonhomie developing in bihar an incident from kanhaiya kumar s statewide yatra  tour  answers this best. just as the touring party was about to depart for the meeting scheduled in banka  shakeel ahmad khan was heard replying to someone s objection.  if people can come to these  kanhaiya s  rallies with the left s red flags  then what is the objection with some carrying the congress s flag  of course they can. if shakeel ahmad khan is with kanhaiya kumar  then it means the congress is also with him. this is the reason why that co ordination committee meeting hasn t happened yet.also read  rise of chandrashekhar azad   from saharanpur s saviour to darling of anti caa protestscaa nrc nprif shakeel ahmad khan is drawing muslim crowds to kanhaiya s rallies  then so is the nationwide protest movement against the narendra modi government s citizenship amendment act  caa  and the twin population registration exercise  the proposed national register of citizens  nrc  and the national population register  npr .the caa nrc npr is the main reason behind the congress  developing support to kanhaiya kumar. the grand old party is itself drawing a lot of support from the muslim community over the caa nrc npr issue. the congress has seen the impact of standing with the rjd on this matter.the rjd called a  bihar bandh  on    december  two days after the left had called for a strike against the caa nrc npr. while no senior congress leader participated in the rjd s bandh  the one held on    december saw massive congress participation  besides several other parties.also read  modi govt s handling of chandrashekhar azad   kanhaiya kumar shows who is the bigger threatcongress and kanhaiyapolitical experts say that the congress  which sees senior leaders like upendra kushwaha and jitan ram manjhi sharing stage with kanhaiya  is benefitting more from the cpi leader  who himself wouldn t mind joining hands with the congress.the question that remains then is why would the congress  in the upcoming election  leave a bigger party like the rjd to join ranks with the left  which barely has any base in bihar the congress itself is answering that. what s wrong in kanhaiya  the left has supported the congress in the past too. our first fight is against sanghvaad  to save the indian constitution   bihar congress president madanmohan jha says in a conversation.several political experts say that kanhaiya has infused a new life in the left  which seemed to be on its deathbed only until a few months ago. the congress  which is disappointed with the rjd s attitude since the lot sabha results  has sensed that kanhaiya brings not just the left with him but smaller parties like ham  rlsp and vip as well.a persistent bone of contention between the rjd and the congress has been sharing of seats. the congress knows it will be the main party of the alliance that will be formed without the rjd  and this will fulfil the party s wish to contest on maximum number of seats.and the rjd camp is helping the congress decide by taking a clear stand  it will rather go it alone than support kanhaiya kumar as the leader.also read  arvind kejriwal s win in delhi can change nitish kumar s election preparation in biharnot lalu s rjdthe congress is also aware that the rjd is no longer the same potent force as it was under lalu prasad yadav s leadership. lalu was the axis around which other alliance partners revolved. now  even the yadav vote bank is not entirely with the rjd. there are several yadav leaders who are effectively countering the rjd leadership  building their own support base.it doesn t matter much to the congress anyway who the yadavs see as their new leader. its sole aim is to pick a face that can successfully challenge the bjp jd u  government. in tejashwi yadav  the congress doesn t see the end of its search   and so it s turning left  towards kanhaiya kumar.but has kanhaiya decided  the cpi leader is yet to make up his mind whether he wants to contest the assembly election. he was non committal during the last conversation.obviously  kanhaiya kumar won t reveal his cards as of now. he knows that the creation of public mood in his favour is still in its early stage. it takes time to build an atmosphere. there are still months to go   perhaps the show of strength will begin

jyotiraditya scindia  sachin pilot have one way to survive politically   by leaving congress
text size  a  a busy battling intra party rivalries  no prominent role in the central leadership  losing elections thanks to a ruptured top command twiddling their thumbs  younger leaders like sachin pilot and jyotiraditya scindia  among others  have to think disruptive and move out of the congress.the ability of the nehru gandhi dynasty to keep the party together is eroding by the day. india s oldest political party must now break up in order for its leaders and ideology to thrive.unlike narendra modi amit shah s bharatiya janata party  bjp   the congress does have a healthy bench strength to boast of  particularly among the young guard. and yet  all that these leaders have done for the past few years is  well  nothing. if they want a sustainable future in politics  these politicians have little option but to cut the umbilical cord.congress  infamous and now perennial old guard versus new guard strife has been in the news yet again with the spats between former congress ministers ajay maken and milind deora  and madhya pradesh chief minister kamal nath and senior leader jyotiraditya scindia. sharmistha mukherjee also called out p. chidambaram on twitter for congratulation the aam aadmi party  aap  for its delhi win.this should be embarrassing for the congress  but more importantly  it ought to worry the scindia pilot category of leaders for what it is doing to their political careers   consuming them in petty rivalries rather than letting them focus on future elections.also read  sharmishtha mukherjee said what many in congress are saying. does she have a follow up plan the turf warsthe scindia kamal nath rivalry in madhya pradesh or the pilot ashok gehlot rocky relationship in rajasthan has been as public as can be  and in a way  has consumed the younger turks completely.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowboth jyotiraditya and sachin had unhidden chief ministerial ambitions  both did their respective tasks in their states and both were restless to make it to the top posts. but when the congress won in madhya pradesh and rajasthan  the top command   which at that point primarily meant then congress president rahul gandhi   chose to go with the older guard as cms.resentment has been brewing since  with both pilot and scindia limited to their states with no national role  and even in their respective turfs  reduced to second fiddle. both have been ministers at the centre in the upa era.the internal wars  however  transcend much beyond just these two leaders.as the sharmistha mukherjee p. chidambaram and milind deora ajay maken fights show  these are all inherent frustrations manifesting publicly. it signals a sense of exasperation and helplessness that seems to have seeped into the younger guard.what meaningful work have other gen next congress leaders  especially those who have lost their elections  been doing  from jitin prasada in uttar pradesh to sushmita dev in assam   no congress leader of this generation is at the forefront  and that is because the only ones allowed national spotlight are the gandhi siblings.the gandhis  meanwhile  seem fairly content about presiding over a collapsing empire  plagued by countless internal wars  games of one upmanship and a completely demotivated second rung.also read  deora  kamal nath  scindia  ajay maken  congress imploding or showing internal democracy a sinking shipby no measure can one write the congress off. after all  nearly    crore indians still vote for it. a revival   in whatever form  be it as splintered groups or with a rejuvenated leadership   is inadvertent. however  politicians like sachin pilot and jyotiraditya scindia can hardly be in politics to sit out of power and waste precious time  which should actually be a movement towards the peak of their careers.there have  in fact  been murmurs of both these leaders  besides others  of looking for options outside the congress.the bigger issue is why these leaders  despite not being unpopular themselves  have lost their elections. a completely uninspired and uninspiring top leadership   especially with rahul gandhi as the face   and a rudderless  strategy deprived party has been their undoing.in the embarrassing rout the congress faced in both the      and      lok sabha elections  only a lucky few survived  with the rest being washed away in the flood of unpopularity and the reputation of the party.rahul gandhi and his sister priyanka gandhi vadra seem interested only in themselves  not in their party or in the growth prospects of their colleagues. the fact that despite the many recent failures  the family hasn t stepped aside  only goes to show they will never cede space to a non gandhi. more worryingly  their approach towards state units also reeks of confusion and insecurity  with no desire to promote and mould younger leaders  lest they emerge as threats.leaders like scindia and pilot may have been family loyalists  and also close to rahul gandhi  but politics is all about the art of self preservation over all else. and these politicians aren t oblivious of that either.for the spirit of the congress party to live on  and for its able young guard to survive  it is imperative they break away   whether together as a cohesive force or in a splintered  but well strategised  fashion. the oldest party of india has become home to the proverbial frogs in a well  where no one   especially the top command   wants to emerge out of the darkness  or allow others to do so. each of these leaders needs to climb out on their own to avoid drowning  and the life jacket they need for that most certainly cannot be their parent party.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis   only you can fix it you are reading this because you value

text size  a  a the congress simply doesn t recover in states where its vote share dips below    per cent  as has happened in uttar pradesh  bihar  odisha  tamil nadu  and west bengal. and its recent loss in delhi wasn t merely a defeat   it signals the burial of the congress in yet another key state.to stem this seemingly interminable decline  tactical tinkering is not enough. the congress must fundamentally reinvent itself. the party is riddled with a ruinous trifecta   weak organisation  unappealing leadership  and confused ideology. unless the congress can address each of these elements  it would continue to shrink  occasional victories notwithstanding.the fundamental flaw of the congress is that  even though it has shrivelled into a catch none party  it still behaves as a catch all party that it was until the     s. in place of a loose  passive centrism that enthuses few people  the congress needs to redefine itself and take advantage of the infirmities of the bjp model of dominance.also read  what the congress party needs is a palace coupcongress  working basethe ideological domination of the bharatiya janata party  bjp  conceals simmering discontent among various groups   dalits  tribals  muslims  and large sections of farmers and poor. there is a vast opportunity for the congress to turn itself into a party of the marginalised and the underprivileged  which would provide it with a formidable base.in fact  in states where the congress has done well in the recent past  it did so through gains made among dalits  tribals  and the economically underprivileged. these are also the states where its primary opponent is the bjp.in gujarat  the congress won    out of    seats reserved for the scheduled tribes  sts   doubled its previous tally in seats reserved for scheduled castes  and won almost twice as many rural seats as the bjp. in chhattisgarh  the congress commanded a lead of    per cent among tribals and    per cent among dalits as compared to the bjp. in madhya pradesh  the lead was    per cent among tribals and    per cent among dalits. in rajasthan  while the tribal vote was equally split  the congress held a   per cent lead among dalits. in all the three states of madhya pradesh  rajasthan and chhattisgarh  the congress did far better among poorer voters than the bjp.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for

of congress and jharkhand mukti morcha  jmm  rode to power by sweeping    out of the    tribal seats. however  in states with strong regional parties  such as delhi  the congress is unable to gain from this disaffection among the marginalised  who prefer a regional party that caters to their interests. in the recently concluded delhi election  which the aam aadmi party  aap  swept  the congress lost its deposit in    out of the    seats it contested. in a state where it was until recently the dominant player  winning three consecutive majorities from       its vote share plummeted to below   per cent.also read  the congress doesn t need a presidentreform at the topit isn t enough for the congress to merely signal resolve or to redefine itself in the abstract. dalits  tribals and muslims won t automatically vote for the congress on the basis of slogans  gestures or symbols. only by taking up the issues of these communities in a sustained manner  and by offering them organisational help and a larger stake in leadership  can the party build a reliable base among them. this will entail reforming the upper caste  nepotistic character of the congress. a good test of this would be whether the congress decides to more actively intervene on the ground on issues such as the citizenship amendment act  caa  and the national register of citizens  nrc   the perceived dilution of reservation for sc sts  and the alienation of tribal land.it is beyond time the congress shakes off its confounding passivity and hits the streets. in lokniti surveys  over the last few years  anywhere between       per cent of voters invariably cite unemployment or price rise as the single most important issue to them in state elections. the combined share of ideological national issues   from ram temple  article      caa to terrorism   is always in single digits. this explains why the bjp has not won a single assembly election outright since the      gujarat election.also read  both hindus and muslims want development. but that s where the similarity endsstaying away from streetsyet  it s difficult to recall the last time the congress organised a sustained campaign on issues of unemployment  farmer distress  or price rise. its activism on these issues is limited to tweets by the gandhis. the congress is not failing because it opposes  albeit cautiously and fitfully  the ideological stands of the bjp. its current state is such because it has singularly failed to transform widespread material discontent among the people into potent political issues.the congress can learn from the new jharkhand chief minister hemant soren  who conducted statewide yatras    yuva sangarsh yatra  and  jan samvad yatra    for a year before the election  covering each constituency  foregrounding the material issues of  jal  jangal  zameen  along with the issues of unemployment and pension. not only was he able to foster a strong sentiment of anti incumbency against the bjp  he built himself up as a strong tribal leader during the campaign.meanwhile  the congress state campaigns are overcentralised and riven with infighting. delhi saw up to four leaders working at cross purposes. in the end  there was no single identifiable campaign whatsoever. the congress needs to move away from the gandhis and empower a single  relatively autonomous  regional leader who can build up the party through sustained campaigns like jaganmohan reddy did in andhra pradesh or hemant soren did in jharkhand.also read  who represents india s muslims  thanks to caa protests  we now know the answerwhat congress needs to doif the congress is able to shake off its political inertia and becomes actively involved in social and political movements  it would substantially address all its three weaknesses.first  the people  particularly from marginalised groups  who might get associated with the party  would provide it with a layer of organisational strength. second  nothing gives the voting public as much clarity on a party s ideology and message as its political movements on the ground. third  it s only through sustained political activities that new leaders emerge and capture the popular imagination.some of these active political stands and political movements might prove counterproductive for the congress. but political inactivity  as the delhi election shows  would be fatal.the author is research associate at centre for policy research  cpr  and scholar in political science at the university of delhi. views are personal.subscribe to our channels on youtube

sharmishtha mukherjee said what many in congress are saying. does she have a follow up plan 
text size  a  a when sharmistha mukherjee  congress  national spokesperson and daughter of former president pranab mukherjee  pulled up p. chidambaram on twitter for congratulating the aam aadmi party on winning the delhi assembly election  she proved that dynastic grudges run deep in the congress party  even if dynasties don t. congress veterans pranab mukherjee and chidambaram have had a long history of differences with each other.what sharmistha mukherjee said goes beyond just dynastic grudges. it is easy to dismiss her   like some did   by reminding her about her father pranab gracing the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh  rss  headquarters in nagpur in june     .but sharmistha s response struck at the heart of an important debate about the congress  game plan   or the lack of it   of defeating the bharatiya janata party  bjp . that a restless young dynast would question the congress sloth is significant.with due respect sir  just want to know  has  incindia outsourced the task of defeating bjp to state parties  if not  then why r we gloating over aap victory rather than being concerned abt our drubbing  and if  yes   then we  pccs  might as well close shop  https   t.co zw

mukherjee s story is symbolic of the crisis that confronts young congress loyalists  whether or not they are dynasts. at a time when the party is struggling for direction and energy  it is the young who get most restless.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define

jaganmohan s case  it was through a padayatra thanking people for mourning his father y.s. rajasekhara reddy s demise. others like himanta biswa sarma  assam s education minister  have exercised the option of joining the bjp and taking their winning tactics there because they were put off by the leadership choosing a second generation dynast over them.for the majority though  staying on is the only viable strategy  even if they don t agree with the regional leadership. former mumbai congress chief milind deora is representative of this group.also read  reinvention  a new face   what congress leaders think party should do after poll debacleno room for other dynastslike many second generation congress leaders  sharmistha mukherjee was airdropped into the party  but has failed to find her feet in it  and is growing increasingly restless and frustrated. like others  she knows the problem  that the congress has room for only one dynasty  but can do little about it. in the recent past  mukherjee twice had to fend off rumours about leaving congress  once for the aap and again for the bjp.but her staying on in the congress hasn t helped either  certainly not in delhi  for which she apologised on twitter.veteran journalist rasheed kidwai says her entry into politics is typical of the congress   deal  politics. her brother abhijit mukherjee and she were given easy access to safe seats  possibly in return for their father not writing a tell all biography that showed the gandhis in a poor light.in       abhijit won the jangipur lok sabha seat after pranab mukherjee vacated it to become india s president. he retained the seat in the      election but lost it in      to trinamool congress  tmc  s khalilur rehman.in sharmistha s case  who was one of the first to criticise her clearly less articulate brother over his infamous  dented and painted  comment for women participating in the protest marches against the      delhi gangrape and murder  the congress gave her a ticket from greater kailash constituency   where she owns a flat since        in the      delhi assembly election.  she also has a home in ranikhet in uttarakhand and  according to her affidavit  she is a fairly wealthy singleton  with assets worth rs  .  crore.  greater kailash was a constituency where congressman virendra kasana was quite popular  though he stood third in the      contest that aap s saurabh bhardwaj won. in typical congress style  kasana s claims were brushed aside for sharmistha.also read  sharmistha not first political heir to publicly slam parentkathak dancer yet to sing political tunea member of the congress since       sharmistha mukherjee is better known as a kathak dancer than a politician. her solitary attempt at electoral politics in      saw her bag only       votes. samir banerjee  her long time neighbour  helped her in the campaign. describing her as a  lovely lady   he recalls that the entire residents  welfare association had worked for her but to no avail.since then  mukherjee      has spent most of her time in tv studios as one of the congress  national spokespersons   she was part of ndtv s debate that saw journalist anchor nidhi razdan throw bjp spokesperson sambit patra out of the show   speaking out on twitter  sometimes even against her own father   and managing pranab s schedule. she spends a lot of time at pranab mukherjee s official residence on rajaji marg. she has also been more than forthright about her party s problems  saying they need to come out of their  exalted echo chambers   and indicating that there is  inordinate delay in decision making at the top .but  as kidwai says  democracy is all about winning elections.  look at a person like raghav chadha in aap. he worked his way up through the party cadre  fought the lok sabha elections in       lost it  contested from rajinder nagar this time in the assembly elections  won. aap has so many success stories like him. bjp has ideological sharpness. what is preventing congress from emulating aap  sharmistha mukherjee is clearly her father s favourite and he often quotes her in his writing. in the coalition years             for instance  he relays a message she had sent to him from ranikhet when his name was first rejected by mulayam singh yadav and mamata banerjee as a possible candidate for president.  she quoted a few lines from one of tagore s famous songs  which i myself frequently consoled people with   dukhero naatey nikhilo dhora jedin koney bonchonatomarey jeno na kori shongshoy  so that on the darkest of nights when the world turns away i may not doubt your benevolent presence.    pranab mukherjee wrote in his book.also read  speaking with the political enemy     hours in the life of pranab mukherjee and daughterfinding her political voicetagore is quite a passion for sharmistha mukherjee  who inherited the love for his songs from her mother  suvra  who set up the geetanjali troupe  with an aim to disseminate tagore s philosophy through song and dance. she passed away in     . mukherjee has often choreographed tributes to tagore.sharmistha mukherjee studied at lady irwin school and then went to the jawaharlal nehru university  jnu  for her post graduation in sociology. she learned kathak with pandit durgalal  uma sharma and rajendra gangani. noted critic ashish mohan khokhar calls her an honest person in art and life. she has no delusions of grandeur  so common in delhi. she does thorough research before staging a production and has done a lot of work in films and modern dance   khokhar told me. he makes a special mention of her dance drama from city of shiva   banaras  and her series on dance  taal mel  which ran on doordarshan in      and was quite popular. her producer for the show then is now bjp s national spokesperson  nalin kohli.it is a pity that like many second generation dynasts  sharmistha mukherjee chose to ignore her core competence and opted for a lateral entry into politics. winning people s hearts with dance is clearly quite different from winning their electoral mandate.with one tweet  she has found a bold  political voice that many studio appearances failed to yield. what she

muslims voting for aap shows they are desperate and congress is too passive  apologetic
text size  a  a i feel like crying  a friend s father whom i met saturday afternoon told me as votes were being cast in the delhi election.  for the first time in    years  i have not voted for the congress.  the gentleman is a muslim and the reason he did not vote for the congress was simple.  my vote would have been wasted. aap still has a chance to win against bjp. according to the india today axis my india exit poll     per cent of muslims have voted for the aam aadmi party  aap .the shifting of the muslim vote from the congress to the aap has made many  almost sanghi  folks in the congress grumblingly suggest ditching the muslim community and pursuing only the majority   hindus   for electoral gains  much like the bharatiya janata party  bjp .also read  not kunal kamra  the real test for indian liberals is sharjeel imamwhy the shiftbut the logic behind the muslim community s shift is not only simple but practical. the muslim voter remains vulnerable in times of the caa nrc npr  which drives her choice to elect a party that will give her anything but divisiveness.aap convener and delhi chief minister arvind kejriwal  in every speech and interview  has insisted that there was no need to amend the citizenship act. he has also continuously spoken of education  development and building infrastructure as part of his election promises.on the other hand  the so called alternative to the bjp   the congress   has not only been passive in its support to shaheen bagh but maintained a safe distance from the protests while issuing the caveat that the movement shouldn t be politicised.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowbut the truth remains   the protests are very much political. they are very clearly anti bjp  but only because it s a bjp project to identify certain muslim citizens whom it can later call  illegal .while congress leaders shashi tharoor and digvijaya singh have  the holy trinity of the party   sonia gandhi  rahul gandhi and priyanka gandhi   have not quite bothered to extend direct support to shaheen bagh.the same could be said about arvind kejriwal  whose hanuman chalisa recitation might have earned him brownie points among sensitive rss inclined hindus who also care about development. but the leading muslim face of the aap  amanatullah khan  has been upfront in showing solidarity with the people of shaheen bagh and the anti caa protesters.also read  how to be bjp s version of a  good muslim    a guide by arif mohammad khancongress vs aapmuslim leaders from the congress have remained conspicuously absent from the scene. there is no muslim leader in the congress today who holds any sway over the community. delhi similarly sees no representation whatsoever. there are some regional leaders in uttar pradesh   salim shervani or naseeruddin siddiqui  who fought from badaun and bijnor  respectively  in the      lok sabha election   but they are as good as non existent nationally. in that election  the congress fielded six muslim candidates in uttar pradesh  and all of them lost.compare this with the aap s outreach to the muslim community. last year  arvind kejriwal hiked the salaries of imams from rs        to rs        per month. the salaries of helpers in mosques was also increased from rs       to rs        a month. these will be paid by the delhi waqf board in     mosques that come under it. in fact  kejriwal went a step ahead and increased the salaries of imams and helpers of mosques that don t come under the delhi waqf board.the congress is slowly and steadily losing its clout over the muslim community. the bjp s constant propaganda of calling the opposition party the  muslim league congress  has seemingly worked and made the congress passive when it comes to taking unapologetic stands on policies that are clearly anti muslim and communally divisive.although the congress  initial official stand on the scrapping of jammu and kashmir s special status was to be against it  its prominent leaders like jyotiraditya scindia  janardan dwivedi  deepender singh hooda and a few others were seen siding with the  nationalistic  view of this move.also read  who represents india s muslims  thanks to caa protests  we now know the answernot just muslimsthe bad news for the congress is that it no longer appears to be ruling the roost when it comes to minority votes. and the delhi election is only going to add another chapter to it. according to india today axis my india exit poll  along with muslims  the congress is set to score poorly even among the other backward classes  obc   the scheduled castes  sc  and the balmikis.what also hasn t helped the congress is that hyderabad mp and aimim chief asaduddin owaisi has repeatedly called out the party as being the torch bearer of draconian anti muslim laws   whether it s the unlawful activities  prevention  act or the severely abused sedition law   that the bjp is now using against the community or anyone against its views.after speaking to many muslim citizens saturday  my biggest takeaway was this  the overwhelming sentiment driving the voting pattern of the community was to choose someone who was most likely to defeat the bjp. it is desperate  survival time. and one look at the congress and the aap makes it clear which of the two can fulfil this basic requirement of the community.the author is a political observer and writer.

modi said caa protests anti national  just like indira gandhi did before declaring emergency
text size  a  a with prime minister narendra modi s speech in parliament  we know how the regime is going to handle the anti caa protests  it is going to be a mix of official equivocation  state repression and politics of polarisation. but the real question is  how are the protesters going to respond let no one be fooled by the polite officialese on this issue. this is deliberate doublespeak. president ram nath kovind s address mentions the plans to extend the national register of citizens  nrc  beyond assam  but the pm denies there has been any discussion on this. home minister amit shah explains the chronology of how the citizenship  amendment  act  or the caa  will be followed by an nrc and be completed by       but his junior  minister of state for home nityanand rai  tells parliament that  as yet  there are no plans to roll out nrc.meanwhile  the national population register  npr   officially the first step towards nrc  has been rolled out. information and broadcasting minister prakash javadekar informs us that the newly inserted questions on ancestry are optional  while pm modi insists that these questions are necessary for the implementation of welfare schemes. none of these clarifications are  of course  put down in any official notification.also read  in       don t rely on routine rallies and marches. modi s india needs new ways to protestregime likely to respond with repressionwhile hundreds of interpretations bloom on the nrc  the npr  and the caa  the modi regime is out to exploit this opportunity for naked communal mobilisation. what we witnessed in the delhi election campaign is only a glimpse of things to come. the bharatiya janata party  bjp  knows that its only hope of winning west bengal next year and uttar pradesh in      rests on creating an open hindu muslim rift. in some parts of hindi heartland  it could also be used to wean a section of dalits and other backward classes  obcs  away from the opposition parties. the bjp is determined to pursue this path.as for the anti caa agitation  one of the biggest peoples  movements since independence  pm modi s statement makes it clear that his government does not view it as a legitimate protest   coming from a section of citizens that needs to be spoken to.notwithstanding the protesters  adherence to the national flag and the constitution  pm modi follows his colleagues in dubbing the protest anti national and an anarchist movement  inspired by the opposition. incidentally  this is exactly how indira gandhi had described the jp movement in       just before declaring the emergency.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowpm modi s language hints at a round of state repression  soon after the delhi election. we could see a crackdown on all shaheen baghs and rounding up of various leaders of the ongoing movement. the repression would be muted  but not absent  in the opposition ruled states. so far  most opposition governments have been rather indifferent  if not hostile  to the anti caa protests. the movement has to devise its own means  without depending much on the major political parties.also read  shaheen bagh  jamia  jnu protests show indian women are far better leaders than we admitanti caa protest needs a new strategythis situation calls for a new strategy on part of the protesters. as i argued earlier  the anti caa protests have now entered the second phase of a nation wide movement for equal citizenship. on   february  hum bharat ke log  an umbrella of more than     organisations involved in the anti caa nrc npr movement  has called for boycotting the npr. they have also planned a month long programme of action from    february  the death anniversary of maulana azad till    march  bhagat singh s martyrdom day.this is what the protesters should do. first of all  the obfuscation by the modi government must be responded with clear communication on the part of the protesters. a clear call to boycott the npr is the first step. more than street protests  communication and dialogue must be the priority for the next two months. while divisive and discriminatory nature of the caa needs to be highlighted  the focus of attention and critique should now be the npr and the nrc that are easier for an ordinary citizen to understand and relate to. the focus of communication should shift from those who are affected and those who already know  understand and agree with the dangers of caa nrc npr to those who are still dimly aware of how it might affect them. these include poor from all communities  adivasis  and nomads who often lead an undocumented existence.second  attempts at polarisation must be challenged by taking on the perception of this being merely a  muslim  protest. this can be done in two ways. one would be to have greater connect with the protests in assam  and with the northeast in general  where most of the protesters are non muslims. the other way would be to enter into a dialogue with those who do not quite agree with the protesters  those who may not feel directly threatened by the new citizenship regime. after all  a struggle to save the constitution cannot be limited to a few communities.third  the movement must find its own positive agenda  beyond opposing the npr nrc and caa. recent surveys have shown that even those who may agree with the caa feel that it is being brought in to distract people s attention from issues like unemployment and the widely felt economic distress. i have suggested that a way to connect the two would be to demand a national register of the unemployed.fourth  the location and form of protest also need to shift. the focus of action should now shift from cities and large towns to smaller towns and villages  from city wide rallies to mohalla meetings. door to door campaigns and face to face dialogue must now be the priority. in choosing the form of protest  a large show of strength is not needed in most parts of india  except in uttar pradesh. now  a premium should be placed on shaheen bagh type protests that evoke empathy among the rest of the population and encourage a conversation. community feasts and inter faith family dialogues should also be promoted to underline the spirit of national unity.fifth  the movement could do with more coordination. while the spontaneous nature of the movement must be maintained  there is a need to focus more on the overlap in demands  cohesion in action  and coordination among various organisations. the movement needs some mechanism to take on the massive propaganda machine unleashed by the modi regime.finally  the state repression has to be met with disciplined non violence. so far  the protesters have shown exceptional maturity and restraint. but it may not suffice in the face of the next round of repression. this would require better training and discipline of the volunteers  many of whom are joining a public protest for the first time.the two month old movement for equal citizenship is an unusual moment in the history of the indian republic. the movement can realise its potential by turning into a movement for a renewal of the idea of india  a true bharat jodo andolan.the author

why congress can t sleep with the enemy to deal with modi phobia
text size  a  a the congress party s vanishing act in the      delhi assembly election must be heartening for the aam aadmi party. the arvind kejriwal led party had secured only    per cent votes   four percentage points less than the congress   in delhi in the      lok sabha election. it had trailed behind the congress in most muslim dominated assembly segments.so  if the congress was putting up a fight in delhi  which it ruled from      to       chief minister arvind kejriwal would be worried. instead of splitting anti incumbency votes  the congress would end up damaging the aam aadmi party  aap  more because the two parties vie for the same vote bank  especially muslims and dalits. that s why kejriwal must be grateful to the congress   for virtually sitting out of the delhi contest.also read  unemployment allowance  cashback schemes   congress releases its delhi poll manifesto star campaigner the bharatiya janata party  bjp   therefore  is livid.  the congress is triggering a short circuit in its own house to ensure that the neighbour has no lights   a rashtriya swayamsevak sangh  rss  functionary from delhi told me last week.  we are missing our star campaigner. if the congress wants to save its money  we can fund and mobilise crowds for his rallies   he added  half in jest. the star campaigner he referred to was former congress president rahul gandhi. the rss functionary s jibe at gandhi  however  also betrayed frustration in the bjp rss camp over what it perceives as the congress party s complicity with the aap in ensuring that the anti bjp votes don t get divided.the congress s star campaigners have stayed away from delhi election  while the bjp has fielded its top guns  including    union ministers led by amit shah and four chief ministers  apart from prime minister narendra modi  to canvass for party candidates. the gandhi family is likely to show up in some public meetings in the remaining four days of the delhi election campaign  but that would be only fulfilling formalities in such a high octane contest.when the gandhi family had virtually stayed out of haryana and maharashtra assembly elections   with rahul gandhi addressing barely half a dozen rallies in both states together   it was due to its conviction in the inevitability of its defeat. it was also a  family strategy  to teach senior leaders a lesson  although it backfired  exposing the gandhi family s electoral irrelevance. in haryana  former chief minister bhupinder singh hooda almost pulled off a victory despite the congress high command  and in maharashtra and later in jharkhand  the fightback was led by its partners   the nationalist congress party  ncp  and the jharkhand mukti morcha  jmm .also read  in last week of delhi campaign  aap

therefore  sensed an opportunity  let the regional parties lead the fightback  the way they were instrumental in the undoing of the atal bihari vajpayee government in     . remember how the dravida munnetra kazhagam  dmk  brought bjp aiadmk to nil in tamil nadu and how the left parties dashed bjp s hopes in west bengal by reducing mamata banerjee s trinamool congress  tmc  to one in the    member lok sabha contingent from the state.much has been written about the difference between the bjp of modi shah in      and of vajpayee advani in     . the congress knows that shah s bjp would be different in       too.after the loss in the      lok sabha election  the rss had pointed out that the bjp had  vyakti  individual   and  vikas  development   but had lost its  vichardhara  ideology  . as it is  if the current trend continues until      lok sabha election  the bjp would again have only two of the three elements    vyakti   whether modi or shah  and  vichardhara .the likely absence of the third element    vikas    is what gives the congress hopes. the bjp has been dismissive of economic doomsayers. the party leaders think   as many congressmen did during manmohan singh regime before        that common people don t understand economic jargon such as fiscal deficit or the gdp growth rate. no wonder  finance minister nirmala sitharaman  in her budget      speech  chose to talk about double digit nominal gdp growth.but modi must know in his heart of hearts that if people are no longer ready to listen to his appeal to vote for his regents  chief ministers hand picked by him   then it could be the first sign of disillusionment   perhaps something like the devotees  grudging acceptance that gods too can make mistakes.also read  why statehood has disappeared from delhi poll campaign   no one cares about it anymore lose to win  strategythe congress party s real fear is not the bjp  it s narendra modi and his personality cult. party leaders throw their arms up in frustration   boss  rahul gandhi or anybody can t do anything. log modi ke baare mein pagal hain  people are crazy about modi . we will have to wait and bide our time.  the congress playing second fiddle in delhi today is a strategy borne out of this frustration. it s a big gamble though  regardless of electoral outcomes.the congress has the history of ceding space for immediate political goals  only to lose it forever. it started with tamil nadu where indira gandhi  in her battle against the syndicate  chose to cede the congress party s political space to the dmk in exchange for its support to her government at the centre. the congress was soon to become a permanent fringe player in tamil nadu.in the     s  sitaram kesri was happy to let congressmen become bystanders as long as lalu prasad yadav of the rashtriya janata dal  rjd  was mobilising huge crowds for his public meetings  which boosted his ego. after sonia gandhi replaced kesri  she never tried to re capture the party s political space because lalu yadav was the first non congress leader of prominence to defend her on her foreign origin issue. the congress is irrelevant in bihar today.look at each state where the congress has been reduced to the political fringe. they tell the same story of the party s inability to recover its political space due to compromises with or surrender to regional outfits   out of convenience or compulsion.the congress is seeking to ride on the regional parties  shoulders again to try to survive the  modi wave . the parties may not mind carrying the congress weight because it may help them stand stable in the face of the rising wave. they will  however  throw the congress down to be carried away by the water of the receding wave.so  if arvind kejriwal wins this election  which party do you think he will find it easier to finish first  no prizes for guessing it right.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis   only you can fix it you are

don t hang godse  said gandhi s sons. this is how nehru  patel and rajaji replied
text size  a  a to hang or not to hang the murderers of mohandas karamchand gandhi   nathuram godse and narayan apte   was a vexing issue for the new government of independent india. governor general c. rajagopalachari  prime minister jawaharlal nehru and home minister sardar vallabhbhai patel were all approached with requests of clemency for the murderers.brajeshwar prasad  a member of the constituent assembly from bihar  wrote to sardar patel   it will be befitting gandhiji s memory to pardon this scoundrel along with others who have been sentenced. they should forcibly made to settle down in the andamans as free man   sardar patel s correspondence  vol    ed  durga das  navjivan publishing house  ahmedabad  page     patel replied   i am sure you will appreciate that nobody knows better than myself what gandhiji would expect me to do in the matter. you can  therefore  leave the matter at that.   sardar patel s correspondence  vol    page     also read  godse  raised as a girl  saw gandhi as an  effeminate  father who didn t protect mother indiaseveral clemency requestsbrajeshwar prasad was not alone in suggesting such a course for the murderers. many prominent gandhians and two of gandhi s four sons  ramdas and manilal  requested clemency for the assassins too. ramdas  who was living in nagpur  requested c. rajagopalachari   rajaji   to send nathuram godse and his associates  to a penitentiary to find out for themselves and ponder and think over if in any way they have achieved this end in view and decide once for all that hinduism or india cannot be and will never be saved by pursuing rss methods . he also suggested establishing a penitentiary if there wasn t one already.  sardar patel s correspondence  vol    page     ramdas wrote a letter to godse and tried to seek permission from the government to meet him in jail. it caused unease among top leaders.nehru wrote to him saying   i confess that you have put me in a difficulty.   sardar patel s correspondence  vol    page      nehru advised him not to visit godse in jail and sought the guidance of rajaji and sardar in this matter. both of them were strictly against any such visit because it would raise godse s stature. rajaji wrote emphatically to sardar patel   it seems ramdas is excited and is not able to restrain his anxiety to talk to condemned prisoners and convert them to the creed of non violence and repentance  what bapu himself was not able to do and to which he was sacrificed like a lamb led to the altar  i am surprised.   sardar patel s correspondence  vol    page     we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowpatel was even more hostile to the idea. he termed it  somewhat quixotic . knowing full well the functioning of godse and his fellow ideological associates  patel wrote to nehru   there is every likelihood of an attempt being made to treat him as a martyr. the discussion which ramdas proposes to have would invest the last days of godse with a certain amount of glory. to me  it appears somewhat quixotic that any attempt should be made to convince a man who has done such a dastardly crime and takes pride in it.   sardar patel s correspondence  vol    page         kishorelal mashruwala  a veteran gandhian thinker and editor of gandhi s paper harijan  wanted to write in favour of clemency in harijan. both rajaji and sardar patel disagreed strongly.saying that  no sensible man would think of abolishing the death penalty in india in the conditions which prevail today   sardar patel informed rajaji what he told to kishorelal. he said   if the death penalty is not to be abolished  then i could not think of a stronger case for the infliction of the death penalty than that of godse. he has committed the worst crime imaginable and as you said in an earlier letter  he stabbed the heart of india .   sardar patel s correspondence  vol    page     according to narayan desai  gandhi s biographer and son of gandhi s close aide mahadev desai   a crowd of around    villages surrounding vedchhi  a town in south gujarat  inspired by veteran gandhian jugatram dave  resolved that abolition of capital punishment in independent india should begin by not hanging gandhiji s murderers.   maru jeevan e j mari vani  vol    navjivan prakashan mandir        page     many other prominent leaders expressed their views  including an old associate of sardar patel and the first speaker of lok sabha  g.v. mavalankar  personal letter to rajaji dated    june       national archives digital collection   president of assam provincial congress debeswar sarma  personal letter to rajaji dated    september       national archives digital collection . walter koethiger from zurich sent a telegram to rajaji saying   with the murderers india kill gandhi once again .     november       national archives digital collection  rajaji forwarded this telegram to patel with a note   it is strange how people can talk like this .      november       national archives digital collection also read  when nehru s india banned a story on gandhi s murder and godse s pastposition of the indian governmentgandhi s son manilal sent a telegram from durban requesting clemency for godse  followed by another telegram on   november      saying   reference my cable appealing for godse s discharge desire include narayan apte whose name was inadvertently left out.   sardar patel s correspondence  vol    page     it is hardly surprising that godse  blinded by the ideology of hatred hoped to convince ramdas about his stand instead.  sardar patel s correspondence  vol    page     nathuram godse s brother and accomplice gopal godse showed no remorse years after the assassination. he said   i don t regret it and never will.   the assassin s assistant  radha rajadhyaksha     january       times of india  he tried to manipulate public opinion by praising the magnanimity of ramdas gandhi and even visiting him on his  ramdas   death bed. godse could appreciate ramdas  magnanimity  but not mahatma gandhi s.after a discussion with sardar patel  rajaji prepared a draft statement. among other things  it clearly stated the position of the indian government. it said   it is suggested in some quarters that as gandhiji favoured the abolition of capital punishment  we ought to extend clemency to those who murdered him. we have not abolished the death penalty and those on whom the responsibility of government is placed cannot make a distinction and treat more favourably those who have chosen to kill the best among us while ordering the execution of the death penalty in

why rahul gandhi remains india s third most important politician
text size  a  a rajmohan unnithan was not the main speaker at a congress rally in jaipur tuesday to articulate youth anger against the narendra modi government s economic policies. there were no giant cut outs of k. sudhakaran on the rally grounds. the entire congress party from jammu to jamnagar wasn t tweeting about what k. muraleedharan said at the rally  because he wasn t invited to speak.the congress party recently went to the national human rights commission to complain about the state of human rights in uttar pradesh. m.k. raghavan was not part of the delegation.when the congress party sat on a protest against caa nrc at raj ghat  v.k. sreekandan was not present. in case he was  it was not a presence highlighted by the congress party before the world.when sonia gandhi recently called an all party meeting to discuss the citizenship  amendment  act  ramya haridas was  perhaps  not in the room.the shiv sena was among the parties that skipped this meeting  refusing to be treated like a subject summoned to delhi by the monarch. nevertheless  to make amends  aaditya thackeray visited delhi the next day and met congress leaders. however  he did not meet benny behanan.assam has been protesting against the caa  and at least four people have died in the state due to police firing. but t.n. prathapan has not visited assam.in the recent state assembly elections in jharkhand  the congress party held a few rallies. but adoor prakash did not address a single one of them. he did not even visit the state.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowsimilarly  anto antony punnathaniyil did not address any rally ahead of the maharashtra assembly election. not his fault  the congress party did not ask him to. the congress did not ask kodikunnil suresh to address any rallies in the haryana assembly election either.no one in the congress party is demanding that dean kuriakose be made party president  since sonia gandhi is only the interim president. next month  the congress party will either extend her term or make someone else the party president. there is no speculation in the media that hibi eden could be made the next president.also read  even if you take rahul gandhi out of politics  the idea of india won t spring back to lifethe third most important politicianin case you are wondering who these people are  they are all lok sabha mps elected on a congress ticket from kerala   just like rahul gandhi. however  all the above events had rahul gandhi as the central figure  or at least one of the central figures.if rahul gandhi is just an mp from kerala  why is he at the centre of the congress party s national programmes whether or not rahul gandhi holds any position in the party  he remains the party s national face  and the gandhi family s heir apparent  a term used to describe  an heir whose claim cannot be set aside by the birth of another heir .rahul gandhi s defenders and congress supporters often rebut criticism of rahul gandhi by asking   if rahul gandhi is so irrelevant  why do you keep criticising him  but rahul gandhi is not irrelevant. being the face of the main opposition party makes rahul gandhi the third most important politician in india  after pm narendra modi and home minister amit shah.these defenders will further say that rahul gandhi s critics have some personal obsession with him. the same people have a personal obsession with narendra modi and amit shah. here s how it works  you cannot talk about national politics without talking about the key figures who shape it  and rahul gandhi remains one of them   unfortunately.also read  priyanka gandhi has gone from congress  brahmastra  to congress liability like brother rahulthe fear of successwhen boris johnson won the uk election last month  his opponent jeremy corbyn decided to resign  categorically stating he won t lead the labour party into another election  ever. technically speaking  rahul gandhi also resigned from the post of congress president  saying he accepts responsibility for the defeat in a voice so mild you could barely hear it. far from declaring that he won t ever lead the congress  rahul gandhi is busy  between foreign trips  trying to revive his political career for the      th time.the open and obvious attempt to once again make it tenable for rahul gandhi to take over as congress president makes his resignation look like a charade.for the sake of the health of indian democracy  we need to continue to be  obsessed  with rahul gandhi. the congress party s main objective today is to re establish rahul gandhi  not defeat the bjp. these two goals often don t go together. the congress party s slogan is not  desh bachao  but  rahul bachao .for example  the reason why the congress wouldn t make a shashi tharoor  another mp from kerala  leader of the congress in lok sabha is because it doesn t want an articulate speaker who might overshadow rahul gandhi. so  the party prefers an adhir ranjan chowdhury  even if his utterances are an embarrassment to the party.rahul gandhi himself wanted a non gandhi to be party president  but sonia gandhi became interim president instead. she cannot afford to take the risk of letting a non gandhi take over the command and control of the party. in the off chance that such a person succeeds  why would anyone want rahul gandhi to return as president habituated to failure  the congress party is afraid of success. what if someone else succeeds  rahul ka kya ho ga also read  the congress strategy on npr nrc caa has been neither here nor therethe more things changewhen the congress party lost the      lok sabha election  it had a mock introspection in the form of an a.k. antony panel. this time it didn t even do that. any introspection exercise will have to find fault with rahul gandhi s strategies and we don t do that  we don t say the prince was wrong.the results on    may changed absolutely nothing in rahul gandhi s life   nothing at all. he s still the national face of the party  he s still ranting against modi instead of telling us about his ideas and achievements  and he still takes one foreign trip after another.the congress waits for rahul gandhi to return from south korea before it can protest at raj ghat against the caa. the congress waits for rahul gandhi to return from italy before it can hold an all party meeting on caa.he makes an average of   foreign trips a month  according to the modi government  if those many trips are possible. even his un obsessed defenders are no longer able to defend his foreign trips in the name of  work life balance . the people of india need an alternative who at least stays in india  sharad pawar said last month. even after this public rebuke from a veteran politician  rahul did not give his new year s holiday a miss.here s a man who doesn t try a different approach even for the sake of experiment. like einstein s definition of insanity  rahul gandhi will keep doing the same thing no matter how many times he fails. and no matter how many times he fails  he will remain the face of the national opposition. do we not deserve better views are personal.subscribe to our

up police didn t become anti muslim under yogi. look at secular congress  bloody past
text size  a  a the yogi adityanath government has clearly given a free hand to the up police to deal with muslim protesters. but it did not train the up police in anti muslim bigotry  islamophobia and violence. that training was received under previous congress governments in uttar pradesh.almost half a century back  muslims in uttar pradesh protesting government legislation were brutally put down by the police. dozens were killed  their property looted and their houses burned. although these were termed as riots  it was mainly state repression because most of the atrocities on muslims were committed not by members belonging to the majority community but by the police.so  when we look at the recent police atrocities on muslims under the adityanath government  it is useful to place it in a larger historical context.it was       indira gandhi was the prime minister  and the home minister   and muslims were protesting a law curtailing the autonomy of the aligarh muslim university  amu . before the elections  indira gandhi had promised to restore the minority status of amu  so this legislation was viewed as a betrayal. this prompted muslims to begin one of the first big protests against the government since independence. the secular congress government showed little patience for these protesters and set a template of state action  that is now being followed by yogi adityanath.this history of police violence in up is important   not as empty whataboutery  but to gain a fuller understanding of the present in light of a blood soaked past.also read  what s inside up police s intel reports on yogi adityanath s hindu yuva vahinibrute forceprevious congress governments displayed a shameful record of shielding policemen accused of atrocities  whether in the      state wide  riots   the moradabad  riots  of       or the meerut riots hashimpura massacre  as a.g. noorani pointed out in an article in the economic and political weekly. the institutional sense of impunity that allows the up police to run amok now was developed during the congress regimes.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowin       there were allegations of police atrocities in many cities of uttar pradesh such as aligarh  firozabad and varanasi. the opposition leader charan singh alleged that muslim houses were burnt by the provincial armed constabulary  pac . in firozabad alone  as many as    people had been killed  according to n.g. goray  an mp at the time.  the muslim community in that town seems to have been the target of every conceivable form of cruelty  looting  stabbing  shooting  burning  molesting  raping. the most shameful thing is that all this was freely indulged in by the forces of law and order in collusion with local goondas   goray wrote in a letter to indira gandhi.much like adityanath today  indira gandhi backed the police force.  the commissioner and the inspector general of police did not find any substance in the allegation that the police  in general  had run amuck   gandhi dismissively replied. in moradabad in      she deflected from ghastly police excesses by characterising it as  a conspiracy to undermine the government . indira gandhi defended the notoriously anti muslim up pac again during the      meerut riots  lamenting the sweeping allegations against it.also read   no rectal bleeding  but police thrashed us and said drink urine   up madrasa

imprisonment for killing    muslims in hashimpura area of meerut in     . this long delayed justice was despite the efforts of then state congress government  which tried to bury the cases.the up government at the time  under pressure from the rajiv gandhi government  withdrew hundreds of cases from meerut. vibhuti rai  who was then superintendent of the police overseeing hashimpura  later wrote a book hashimpura    may explaining how the pac had rounded up dozens of muslims from riot torn meerut and had killed them in cold blood.  hashimpura remains a disgraceful instance of the merciless and barbaric use of brute state force and a spineless  politically expedient government lying prostrate before its own men  the killers   rai wrote in his book.in the    riots reported in uttar pradesh  the up pac was accused of massacring muslims in   . as late writer and activist asghar ali engineer wrote    in all up riots the pac plays anti muslim roles .also read  in yogi bastion

resort to counter any  disturbance .the naked communalism of yogi adityanath s government  the brutality of the up police  or the political marginalisation of muslims have not sprung up from a vacuum.

even if you take rahul gandhi out of politics  the idea of india won t spring back to life
text size  a  a historian ramachandra guha s claim that the gandhi family is forcing people to vote for narendra modi is tempting but utterly misconceived. it offers a simplistic solution out of the quagmire that indian liberalism finds itself in  remove the gandhis and the idea of india will magically spring back to life.guha has chastised kerala voters for  handing over the advantage to narendra modi . wrong diagnosis  wrong solution. modi won because indian society has changed  not because of rahul gandhi.the ideological factorguha s superficial reading is incorrect because of three reasons. first  it obscures the fundamental ideological shift that indian politics has been undergoing in the last three decades  of which modi is only the culmination. political scientist suhas palshikar has argued that the bjp has taken over the  middle ground of competitive politics  with a  rebuilding of majoritarian politics  starting with the ram janmabhoomi movement.political scientists pradeep chhibber and rahul verma also concluded that  the resounding electoral success of the bjp in       is the result of an ideological  and structural  shift in indian politics. chhibber and verma deduce from their empirical study of voter responses that the main factor behind the congress  weakness is the dissonance between the ideology of the party and the average voter s  it s not the leadership.even if the congress were to choose a new leader  it would suffer from the same encumbering ideology that has a much weaker appeal. it is about the public and the political culture  not the gandhis. the former will take a long time to fix. hoping gandhis  exit will reverse long term socio political shifts is naive.also read  two reasons that can keep caa nrc protests

your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowif not gandhis  who second  this argument assumes that the congress has a ready line of nationally popular leaders waiting to take the mantle. a quick glance at the alternative options should disabuse you of any such notion. sachin pilot and jyotiraditya scindia are dynasts themselves  so they obviously don t fit the bill. moreover  scindia  like rahul gandhi  lost his own family seat of guna  madhya pradesh  in the      lok sabha election. amarinder singh  often projected on social media as an alternative  is not popular outside his home state of punjab. or for that matter  pilot outside rajasthan. p. chidambaram is ensnared in a corruption scandal. shashi tharoor is good for social media and college campuses  but will be laughably ill equipped to challenge modi in the heartland states. in fact  it is hard to recall the congress ever deploying him to campaign anywhere outside kerala.one might argue that this dearth of leaders is the fault of the gandhis for not grooming strong leaders and building their national profiles out of insecurity. one might also argue that state leaders can quickly transform into national leaders if given the right opportunity. they might cite the journey of narendra modi from the chief minister of gujarat in      to becoming by far the most popular leader in india within two years.but modi by      had built an unmistakable brand across urban india  aided by clever marketing  such as around  vibrant gujarat  summits  and a commanding social media presence. even then  he was probably the politician with the most appeal  manmohan singh had lost his shine  among middle class indians who were the first to embrace him. they saw in modi an effective  no nonsense  even authoritarian  administrator  who had developed gujarat and will be the perfect antidote to the weak manmohan singh. his dramatic record of anti muslim prejudice found him frenzied adulation among the bjp base  and quieter approval across many middle class living rooms.in comparison  what is the brand of scindia  pilot  amarinder singh or tharoor  what are their core achievements or alluring life story that will potentially resonate across india also read  foolish to think hindus who voted modi twice will shift due to threat to muslim citizenshipimportance of gandhisthird  if the problem was just rahul gandhi  why did the powerful mahagathbandhan in uttar pradesh  the rjd in bihar and the aap in delhi roll over so easily  could it be because there are structural factors  like the emergence of a new middle class  rapid penetration of social media  especially whatsapp   the domination of the bjp over the electronic media  and  especially  the widespread adoption of a politically majoritarian ideology among the other backward classes  obcs . in the national election  the ideology of no opposition party could remotely compare in popular appeal to the heady mix of the bjp s hindutva and nationalism.the opposition will not find a leader to challenge modi in the game of presidential style popularity contests  at least not in the foreseeable future. the opposition must therefore play a different game  in which it can win. atal bihari vajpayee was indisputably the tallest leader in       yet he lost the elections because the opposition played to its strengths  stitching up a broad coalition around bread and butter issues. for the last two years  the bjp has performed poorly in state elections because these have largely been about material issues  not about narendra modi and the hindutva imbued nationalism that he embodies.the gandhis are still important to the congress  primarily because they manage disputes between various factions and keep the party together. without them  the party might risk splintering. also  for those invested in a secular idea of india  the gandhis remain the best bet that the congress will remain tethered to its founding ideals and not sway in the current of public opinion. the congress  stand on kashmir and triple talaq  for instance  would likely have been different under an alternative leadership.whether rahul gandhi continues in his current role as a davis cup style non playing captain or assumes a more formal leadership role in the near future  the key for the congress is to de emphasise leadership  as it has been doing for the past few months .at the end of the day  no one forces people to vote for pragya thakur  sakshi maharaj or giriraj singh. intellectuals like ramachandra guha lambasting rahul gandhi are welcome to do so  provided they criticise him for his own political failings  and not use him as an excuse for the moral failings of indian society.the author is a research scholar in

does ram guha blame modi voters like rahul s  a historian s job is to assess  not admonish
text size  a  a jawaharlal nehru had a daughter. that daughter had a son. that son had a son. and that son is constantly blamed for it.lineages in india are more often than not mentioned with pride   but not for rahul gandhi  the son of an italian mother with three prime ministers of india in his bloodline. and while he was  still  recovering from electoral defeat in the      lok sabha election  historian ramachandra guha chose to pounce on his legacy too.at the recent kerala literature festival in kozhikode  guha blamed malayalis for electing rahul gandhi to parliament from wayanad. he also went on to say that the fifth generation dynast stood no chance against self made narendra modi. last i checked  india was still a democracy and criticising a politician was normal.  this doesn t apply to ajay singh bisht though . guha s statement was especially unsurprising because he has blamed the gandhis many times in the past.he has also clarified that this comment was cherry picked from his speech at the lit fest.but the battered image of rahul gandhi as an entitled half politician has become the go to criticism every time you want to show your allegiance to the powers that be. and ramachandra guha using the same old  dynast  jibe at rahul makes one think  did the detention in bangalore get to him also read  dynast rahul gandhi has no chance against self made modi  ramachandra guhaa false equivalenceone wonders how many times ramachandra guha has chided modi voters in various constituencies for voting for the bjp. a historian has to assess and evaluate. not admonish voters.modi has had a    year career as a chief minister and five as a prime minister. a gandhi standing opposite him does not chip away at that image  as the lok sabha elections have proved. his past  with the gujarat model and gujarat riots  has left no space for fence sitting. either you re for modi or against him.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowemphasising modi s self made credentials would only make sense if rahul gandhi was in a position of power due to his lineage. he has barely sunk his teeth into indian politics and has even lost the gandhi bastion in amethi. there are no electoral freebies for rahul for just being a gandhi. he is not even the congress president anymore.so  guha is drawing a false equivalence. he is wrongly putting the onus of modi being in power on one leader from the opposition  no matter how many times he s been branded as irrelevant and matchless to the charisma and oration of modi. also  guha should know by now that no one is actually self made in politics. one can t discredit the mammoth backing of the sangh parivar and corporates to modi.also read  how the right is tackling left s intellectual hegemony in delhi   one think tank at a timewayanad s loud noi m in no position to advice someone as able as ramachandra guha  but instead of admonishing keralites  he should congratulate them for sending a big message to amit shah s communal campaign in wayanad. shah had said wayanad looked like pakistan just because of the constituency s sizeable muslim population. the bjp has been trying to stake its claim in south india  and wayanad voting rahul is a loud  no  to shah s divisive politics.in fact  guha sounds childish when belittling lineage. one would expect better of an  expert  who boasts about the achievements of his nephew  son and grandfather. the smart genes definitely run in the family and there is no need to be embarrassed about it. just like rahul gandhi doesn t need to be apologetic about coming from a political family that has served india since before independence.also read  from writing history to becoming a part  how ramachandra guha became face of caa protestsa true historian wouldn tguha s speech at the kerala lit fest is based on an article he wrote for outlook where he discussed constitutional patriotism versus jingoism. in it  he tries to dissect the reasons why modi came to power.guha mentions that one of the salient features of constitutional patriotism is the  ability to feel shame at the failures of our state and society . although one can t deny that guha has been rather critical of the modi government  but creating the modi vs  rahul gandhi and his fiefdom  narrative is not only unimaginative  but also tries to put the onus of misgovernance by the modi government on a person who barely has any stake in it.guha also faults the left for having a greater allegiance to other countries such as erstwhile ussr and china rather than india. an even more irrelevant segment in india s politics as it stands today.ramachandra guha calls the  chamchagiri culture of the congress party  a big disgrace. there s no denying it. the durbar style organisation of congress is insufferable. however  the chamchagiri is very much alive and kicking within the bjp too. entire elections are run and fought only on one name   narendra modi. the jobs of the external affairs minister  defence minister  finance minister are in effect handled by the pm   from world tours to demonetisation to using clouds in airstrikes. these are things guha doesn t admonish voters for.so  rather than drawing false equivalence and playing a balancing game  ramachandra guha should act like a true historian   one who knows that history remembers every word.the author is a

aaditya thackeray gets away with things that rahul gandhi can t
text size  a  a aaditya thackeray is just    years old but has already outdone his father and maharashtra cm uddhav thackeray  uncle raj thackeray and grandfather bal thackeray by being the first thackeray to contest and win an assembly seat. often seen driving around mumbai in his bmw that apparently cost just rs  .  lakh because  of course  the thackerays are so hard pressed to accumulate wealth that they buy second hand cars  aaditya thackeray is the new young gun in maharashtra politics who isn t playing by the rules.in a parallel world  imagine congress leader rahul gandhi going on a night out with a young and good looking bollywood actress. news channels would ve gone into a tizzy. anchors would ve snapped their veins by shouting at the audience to look at the gandhi brat painting the town red with an actress. they would ve declared rahul unfit for politics and guffawed at his audacity. media would ve announced his nikaah or christian wedding  whichever religion works better for your imagination or hatred  since his janeu has been dismissed by half of india s population. rahul gandhi would ve been the butt of all jokes.also read  shiv sena s aaditya thackeray won t be cm  but he is teaching congress a lesson in politicsa sobo boy  not a political leaderbut aaditya thackeray seems unapologetic about his life. he has been spotted with actress disha patani and seems unaffected by people s opinion.this is also perhaps why no one is taking him seriously in politics  which is all about perception. and aaditya thackeray s image so far is of a boy who is being pitched for a man s responsibility he isn t capable of undertaking yet. sounds familiar  it s no surprise that home minister amit shah refused to give in to shiv sena chief uddhav thackeray s demands of making his son aaditya  and not bjp s devendra fadnavis  the cm. in fact  ncp congress too didn t really warm to this suggestion and pushed uddhav thackeray  the once reluctant son of former shiv sena supremo bal thackeray  to become the cm.aaditya thackeray brandishing a bracelet studded with     diamonds is everything that an indian politician shouldn t do. having written a book of poems and penned lyrics for a private music album  aaditya thackeray is just another boy that fits the sobo culture rather than maharashtra s legislative assembly.also read  this is what uddhav thackeray s cm rule will mean for ncp  congress   bjpwe are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowvibrant nightlife activistit s only fair that uddhav thackeray hustled so hard for his son because he had rahul gandhi s example in front of him. after all  rahul s political journey is more a warning than a model for others.if rahul s career would ve started in       he wouldn t be struggling to create support for himself today as a national leader. he even lost amethi to bjp s smriti irani. that s how much rahul gandhi s image has cost him. the burberry jacket wearing gandhi scion has got everything on a silver platter. aaditya thackeray fits the same bill  which is why aaj tak s anjana om kashyap was heard calling him shiv sena s rahul gandhi on a live show.consider yourself warned  aaditya. it doesn t take long for youth to be dismissed in india s geriatric politics. we forgive the old netas for much more and are less generous toward the young.but then  aaditya thackeray is quickly reinventing how young politicians can appeal to the youth      per cent of india s demography. aaditya has been instrumental in pushing for a better nightlife in mumbai by allowing later hours and lighter restrictions for people to party. with the example of new york and london  he pitches the idea of a vibrant nightlife for a better economy. it can t get more millennial than that.however  aaditya thackeray s politics isn t without irony. he spoke against the cutting down of aarey forest trees for a metro car shed while his party shiv sena was in the very government and the brihanmumbai municipal corporation  bmc  that was instrumental in felling the trees.also read  not amit shah nor pawar  history s chanakya was more than just an indian machiavellipractising secularism for a changebut perhaps aaditya s  yuppie ness  is the makeover the party needed. actually  this is a contrast to rahul gandhi and the congress party s image. rahul needed to show he is aam aadmi and shed his  yuppie ness  by doing mgnrega labour work years ago and sleepovers in rural homes. but all that aaditya needs to do is show he is not a violent vandaliser of cinema halls and shops.in the run up to the      maharashtra assembly election  we saw the shiv sena once again play the hindutva card by demanding the ram mandir in ayodhya. however  the party made the biggest mistake here. shiv sena has been the party of the  marathi manus    the guys who beat up biharis and  up ke bhaiyas  in maharashtra to show them who is the boss. by turning to hindutva  sena strayed away from the marathis.now  maharashtra only had to choose between a regional party offering hindutva and a national party offering hindutva. no one can beat the bjp at hindutva  which is why shiv sena would ve been defeated after this election  even if it was in the government this term.the shiv sena  though reportedly reluctant initially  now stands by a common minimum programme that claims to uphold  secular  values. this is a first for the shiv sena since it was founded in      because it has never been secular.but then it has promised jobs for local people  and with that  the shiv sena has once again brought the marathi people at the centre of its agenda and set it itself apart from the bjp. no  shiv sena is no longer just maharashtra s  bjp lite .also read  shiv sena was hated by indian liberals as extremist hindutva party. now

if bjp leaders could speak like rahul bajaj  this is what they would tell modi   amit shah
text size  a  a industrialist rahul bajaj has earned the admiration of union ministers  parliamentarians and even leaders of the bharatiya janata party with his latest remark. people are scared of speaking up against the narendra modi amit shah government because it won t be appreciated  the bajaj group chairman said bluntly at the economic times  et awards      saturday.the bjp  might have applauded rahul bajaj  though quietly. now that shah has clarified  kisi ko darne ki koi zaroorat nahi hai  no one needs to fear    some bjp leaders may gather enough courage one day to break what

the congress formed the government in madhya pradesh  chhattisgarh was carved out of it in       and rajasthan  but the nda returned to power at the centre the next year.in december       the bjp

followed by the party s sweep in all three in lok sabha elections in may       therefore  didn t indicate any new trend.the bjp might have been left high and dry after the shiv sena joined hands with the congress and the ncp to form the government in maharashtra under uddhav thackeray last week  but it doesn t indicate any drastic change in the public s voting preferences. these three parties

in the ncp and the congress. in its desperation to replace the congress as the only national party with pan india presence in power  the bjp has been borrowing heavily from its principal rival s playbook   using central probe agencies to  neutralise  political opponents  orchestrating defections  horse trading  using constitutional offices to serve political ends and portraying pleas for political morality or propriety as excuses of losers.brand modi was supposed to be the antithesis of such politics. if this brand suffers  no amount of political manipulations  agenda setting or

but with the delivery mechanism he put in place in their states.it s also visible in the form of jokes targeted at pm modi on whatsapp or social media platforms. for instance  a joke doing the rounds on whatsapp nowadays is how residents of a village in karnataka flagged two of their problems to modi when he visited them. the first problem was the absence of any doctor in the village. as the joke goes  modi took out his mobile and called someone. he then told the villagers that the doctor would be available in their village from the next day.  now  what s your second problem   he asked. the villagers responded timidly   sir  there is no mobile network in our area. such jokes may be the handiwork of opposition parties   though i refuse to attribute such wit and humour to them   but their wide circulation against modi is only a recent phenomenon.until recently  such jokes were almost exclusively targeted at congress leader rahul gandhi and other opposition leaders. even those who swear by modi don t mind circulating anti modi jests now. that shows a change among modi loyalists.if they were as free as rahul bajaj  the bjp leaders would like to tell modi shah that the memes and jokes are the first hint of the melting of their carefully constructed persona.there are a number of other things bjp members would want the party leadership to change  be it their involvement in decision making  promotion of regional leaders from state leadership  and choosing talent over loyalty  among others.but they are not losing hope yet. they can rely on the discredited opposition to cover up the failings of governance. as for modi s popularity  here is british music artist rod stewart s      song reason to believe giving voice to the faithful   if i listened long enough to you  i d find a

this is what uddhav thackeray s cm rule will mean for ncp  congress   bjp
text size  a  a the last thing one expected from the dyed in the wool saffron party shiv sena was to ascend to power on two crutches  the congress and the ncp. both the parties have been sworn enemies of the saffron brigade for more than four decades in maharashtra politics.and that is why the shiv sena put up a grand show at shivaji park for the swearing in of uddhav thackeray as the chief minister of maharashtra thursday. it was a sign the hindu hriday samrat balasaheb thackeray s son had to give to the party faithful to assure them that there is no change in the colour of their brand of hindutva in the rainbow coalition.  gained nothing lost everything  is an adage that best applies to him now.while i wish him well  it is unlikely that this regime in maharashtra will last even six months.the shiv sena can savour the moment of borrowed glory  but not for long. the shiv sena ncp congress government may not last long  not because it is a wishful thinking of the bjp. the dynamics of coalition politics does not allow such an artificial alliance to stick together for long. it does not benefit the congress to share power with the shiv sena and squander away its vote bank  or whatever little is left of it. the highly unpredictable nationalist congress party  ncp  too may not like to partner with the shiv sena for too long at the risk of losing its vote share and economic and administrative clout in maharashtra.it would be easier to predict the weather than the twists and turns in maharashtra politics  at least as long as maratha strongman sharad pawar is in command. in the last few days  he has more than once proved that  pawar saheb will always have the last word in government formation in maharashtra .also read  shiv sena was hated by indian liberals as

started off on the wrong foot from day one. in the run up to the assembly election  the party s glee over the ed notice to sharad pawar in relation to a scam in a state cooperative bank was hard to

trusted lieutenants udayanraje bhosale  got him to resign as an ncp mp and made him contest on a bjp ticket. pawar ensured bhosale tasted defeat.then  the bjp  as a single largest party  foisted pawar s nephew ajit as the deputy chief minister in a coup. in a quick move  pawar fortified his camp and turned the tables on the bjp in less than    hours. the prodigal nephew is back with the ncp  and will eventually be re admitted into the pawar camp.the biggest lesson for the bjp is never to underestimate the strengths  covert and overt  of its political adversaries.the congress was almost written off in maharashtra with no tall leader anywhere in sight. besides  it was evident that the state and central leadership were not on the same page on a number of issues.yet  its alliance with the ncp prevented the splitting of the crucial maratha votes. as a result  both the parties retained and even marginally improved their seat share compared to     .also read  supriya sule was the darling of lutyens  delhi  but is now maharashtra s very own taibjp needs to read new bookspoaching existing leaders from other parties and promoting lightweight non entities will not help the bjp storm the pawar stronghold.the lesson for the bjp is   wait for the right moment but keep building inroads in western maharashtra through confidence building measures. further  the party needs to read some new books on how to keep old friends and win over new ones.the bjp could have roped in both the shiv sena and the ncp to form a new coalition. this would have meant forgoing some important portfolios. but  at this juncture  it was important for the bjp to be in power  especially when elections in jharkhand are around the corner.it should not come as a surprise to the bjp if some of its allies in other states now start contemplating a shift in their position. it may not happen overnight but political realignments can be quick.it is not principles vs pragmatismthe bjp and the shiv sena have always kept their doors wide open to allow free entry of turncoats. nearly half of the current strength of the bjp is made up of  outsiders   who joined the party in      or later for reasons other than ideological.nothing can stop these turncoats to return to where they originally belonged. it is always difficult for a cadre based  ideologically sound party to compromise with principles for the sake of convenience and political expediency. the bjp should know that in politics  principles and pragmatism are not two sides of the same coin. they run parallel.not easy for ncp  congress eitherfor the congress  supporting a shiv sena led government is like trying to remain afloat with an albatross around its neck.it s tie up with the ncp will not allow the congress workers to operate independently in the ncp stronghold constituencies. the party will continue to play second fiddle to the ncp  and now to the shiv sena as well  much to the chagrin of loyal workers.the congress should stop dreaming about a congress ncp merger   pawar will not allow that in maharashtra although he is aware that the ncp s pan india reach is limited.but the ncp too is a one man army. the party has no second rung leadership  cadre base or ideological moorings. it has its origin in an ego clash between pawar and former congress president indira gandhi. the many layers of agricultural economic outfits  sugar cooperatives and rural banks that sharad pawar has built may not operate as a political bulwark for long.aware of the constraints  pawar himself has suggested that it is time for the revival of the congress but has advised the gandhi family not to take the leadership issue for granted.maharashtra politics has shown that every party has many arrows in its quiver. and  one never knows who will shoot the next arrow.also read  will joining shiv sena ncp alliance help revive congress or damage it further nationally the author is a member of the national executive

modi s new love  fundamental duties indira gandhi inserted in constitution during emergency
text size  a  a soon after his spectacular victory in the      lok sabha election  prime minister narendra modi said in parliament that there was a need for a  paradigm shift  in india   from the centrality of fundamental rights to the fundamental duties. many in media  parliament  and among the common public saw the statement in a positive light and found nothing controversial  modi was most likely rendering a version of john f. kennedy s  ask not what your country can do for you  ask what you can do for your country .then it was reported that the ministry of human resource development has sent a letter to all institutes of higher education  laying out the guidelines on how to celebrate constitution day. what is striking about the letter is its repeated focus on fundamental duties for this year s celebration. but this is not a one off incident. there was a letter sent out in      too wherein fundamental duties were similarly given special attention. it is quite clear that modi and the state apparatus under him seem to believe that the thrust of constitutional education and constitutional discourse must be centred around fundamental duties.in a recent op ed in the new york times  modi quoted gandhi   the true source of rights is duty  if we all discharge our duties  rights will not be far to seek .also read  pledge to follow fundamental duties   how govt wants students to mark    yrs of constitutionmodi s indira connectionironically  in this  modi is a lot like former pm indira gandhi. there were no fundamental duties in the constitution that our founders adopted on this day    years ago. it was introduced through the   nd amendment in      in the middle of emergency as part    a by gandhi. she set up a committee chaired by then external affairs minister swaran singh  to study the question of amendment of the constitution in the light of experience   the all india congress committee  aicc  suggested to the swaran singh committee to  formulate some proposals for inclusion in the constitution certain fundamental duties and obligations which every citizen owes to the nation  .the committee then drew up a list of fundamental duties  which included the duty to adhere to the constitution  uphold india s sovereignty  and contribute with national service among other things  which the congress party tweaked. interestingly  the congress rejected the committee s proposal to give parliament the power  by law  to impose punishment and penalties on citizens who didn t adhere to the fundamental duties.by november       both houses of parliament passed the   nd amendment  which included a new fundamental duties chapter to the constitution. the   nd amendment entailed a number of significant changes to the constitution and is often referred to as a  mini constitution  or  indira s constitution . it curtailed fundamental rights and destabilised the separation of powers in favour of the indira gandhi led government.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowalso read  the    point checklist on how to be an autocrat   and here s how modi fits the billconstitution s focus was always on rightsmodi s citation of m.k. gandhi in the new york times article to support his emphasis on  duties  is indeed correct. however  gandhian thinking on rights and duties represents only a sliver of india s constitutional tradition. most of indian constitutional thinking  forged in the crucible of our freedom movement  emphasised rights and not duties.apart from one or two instances where members of the constituent assembly echoed gandhi s idea on rights and duties  we find no evidence that remotely suggests that the framers of our constitution seriously considered adopting something that resembled fundamental duties. while they might have had moral and political convictions about the links between rights and duties  they did not find it appropriate for these to be encoded into the indian constitution. fundamental rights were given the most emphasis.b.r. ambedkar  the chairman of the constituent assembly s drafting committee  called article      containing the provision that provided remedies for the violation of fundamental rights   as the  soul of the constitution .also read  india s founders gave us our constitution. we must prove to them that we can keep itauthoritarian regimes emphasise duties over rightsthis is not to say the idea that citizens must perform certain duties towards their fellow citizens and society is not important. a lot of what we have in our fundamental duties chapter is laudable and must be aspired to. however  when political leaders and the state equate duties with rights  or worse  elevate the former over the latter  alarms bells should ring  especially when this happens in a political ambience flush with majoritarianism and under an authoritarian leader.but why would the modi government want us to pay less focus on rights to freedom  equality  non discrimination  minority welfare  etc and instead obsess over our fundamental duties inserted during indira gandhi s emergency  well  authoritarian regimes know that they can profit immensely from such a  paradigm shift .first  this shift allows the state to erect a mask over violations of citizen s rights. when citizens are exclusively concerned about the performance of duties  issues of rights are relegated to the fringes of their attention. we would focus on state assigned homework to ensure our streets are swachh  clean  and remain oblivious to the rights of manual scavengers.by using the language of  duties   any call for accountability of state action that violates rights can be dismissed as a form of selfishness   you keep talking of rights but what about your duties   was something that was heard during the jnu kanhaiya kumar episode. the students  claims to right of free expression and protection against state violence were responded with some form of  you are a student. it is your duty to study  not protest .a republic that is brainwashed into thinking that fundamental duties are the cr me of the constitution  can slowly begin to worship the very concept of duty itself   even if this duty has nothing to do with the actual content in the chapter on fundamental duties in the constitution.the bjp government is stellar at handpicking certain fringes of india s constitutional tradition that it finds agreeable and dressing them up as the constitution s core. it performs fancy footwork around india s constitutional and political history to dazzle the citizenry into confusion about the republic s founding ideals. today  the   th anniversary of the adoption of india s constitution is a good time to remind ourselves to self educate and strive for clarity on what kind of a constitutional republic our founders wanted us to be.the author is the senior associate editor for constitutional and civic citizenship at the centre for law and policy research  bengaluru where he works on initiatives to facilitate and

whether it s cm fadnavis or cm thackeray  the only winner in maharashtra is rahul gandhi
text size  a  a rahul gandhi had reasons to celebrate saturday evening. nationalist congress party chief sharad pawar s nephew  ajit pawar  had saved the day for all dynasts in indian politics by supporting the bharatiya janata party in maharashtra. imagine the implications of the congress coming to power in a state despite the nehru gandhi family having played virtually no role in the election campaign   while sonia gandhi and priyanka vadra stayed away  rahul gandhi addressed barely half a dozen rallies in both haryana and maharashtra. it would be a blow to all political dynasties. it was already bad enough that the congress had put up a creditable resistance in the two states after the party s first family abandoned the fight  hoping to teach its veterans a lesson in defeat.the election results were especially shocking to rahul gandhi. he hasn t said a word on the poll outcome in the past one month  not to speak of congratulating party veterans on turning things around. have you seen or heard of a leader who goes into a sulk because his party has done well in the elections rahul gandhi s trusted lieutenant k.c. venugopal  who ran away from the electoral fray in the      lok sabha election  echoed his boss s sentiments as he opposed a tie up with the shiv sena. but the fear of large scale defections in the party  more than the temptation to keep the bjp out of power in india s most industrialised state  prevailed over sonia gandhi s motherly instincts  she gave a go ahead for talks with the shiv sena.whatever the outcome of the perceived or genuine rift in pawar family  rahul gandhi can now claim the moral high ground. the former congress president will be the winner  regardless of whether the chief minister s post in maharashtra goes to bjp s devendra fadnavis or shiv sena s uddhav thackeray.if fadnavis manages to prove his government s majority on the floor of the state assembly  as and when it comes to that depending on the supreme court s decision monday  congress veterans should brace themselves for a massive assault from rahul gandhi s lieutenants   how could you  destroy  our secular credentials by agreeing to ally with the shiv sena    rahulji   to them  personifies the party s secular ideology  he wears a janeu  visits temples  and went to kailash mansarovar just as he vowed to scrap triple talaq law  made alleged defamatory remarks against the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh  rss  and respected but didn t  welcome  the supreme court s ayodhya verdict. these veterans would have a lot of explaining to do why they shouldn t be exiled to the island of saint helena for damaging rahul s secular image.in the congress  eventual defeat in the current political tussle in maharashtra  therefore  lies the former party president s victory. he had held these veterans responsible for the congress  defeat in the      lok sabha election while resigning from the party s top post in july.and if these veterans manage to foil the bjp s plans and install a congress ncp shiv sena government  so what  the victory would still be rahul gandhi s. maharashtra and haryana election results were a vindication of his political philosophy  anyway   if india is computer  congress is its default programme. we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive

allusions . also read  why congress keeps deferring its protests on economy   rahul s vanishing act  state pollswhy bjp may not grudge this gandhi winthe reader  or voters today  may be  seldom pleased  as johnson  the   th century poet critic  noted. but the political theory of victory by default seems to pervade a large section of the opposition camp today.rahul s tenure as an  active politician    given that he makes only guest appearances in india nowadays   was known for ideological confusion  political pusillanimity  and near stasis. it s no different for his contemporaries in indian politics. every time they are required to make bold political and ideological statements  they take refuge in literary couplets and poems to hedge their insecurity and confusion. after the supreme court delivered its verdict on ayodhya title dispute and the bjp went to town claiming credit for it  samajwadi party leader akhilesh yadav reacted with a couplet on twitter   jo faisle faaslon ko ghatate hain  wo insaan ko behtar insaan banate hain  decisions that reduce distances make human beings better .  one can only surmise that he wanted muslims to accept the decision but wouldn t say it in as many words.tejashwi yadav of the rashtriya janata dal  rjd  expressed his  respect  for the supreme court s decision  adding   every temple  mosque  gurudwara and church in the country is ours only sab apne hain.  they were all taking the congress line  expressing respect for the verdict but not welcoming it with the hope of pleasing both hindus and muslims.like rahul gandhi  both yadavs  expected to lead the resistance against the bjp in uttar pradesh and bihar  have been running their politics through their twitter handles  with the public as well as their parties  rank and file guessing about their whereabouts.it s not just the yadavs. most opposition leaders do their politics through twitter   mayawati  sitaram yechury  hemant soren  you name it. the bjp  despite its national domination  has been on the streets of west bengal to try to dislodge mamata banerjee in the      assembly election but opposition leaders who would face election in the next two years mostly remain in cyber space. why bother when they are sure of regaining power by default also read  when enemy s friend is your friend  congress ncp take a leaf out of bjp left bookopposition in need of rahul s jupiter s escape velocitymamata banerjee is a formidable opposition leader who has made the bjp sweat for every inch it has gained in west bengal. her silence on ayodhya verdict and the recent attack on mp asaduddin owaisi of the aimim betrayed her frayed nerves. she is trying to retain her muslim vote bank without antagonising hindus. one can find many faults with her politics.but while mamata is doing what she does best  the main credit goes to the bjp  which has been relentlessly changing the goalpost for opposition players. they have been left huffing and puffing in trying to match its pace on nearly every issue   surgical strikes  triple talaq  balakot air strike  article      ayodhya dispute  and now the national register of citizens  nrc . blame it on their ideological and political bankruptcy  they have always been found fumbling for a cogent response. they may be looking at rahul gandhi to get some guidance on how to acquire jupiter s  escape velocity  to beat amit shah led bjp s gravitational pull.the former congress president does not seem to have any clues either. but their spirit is indomitable.  in the fell clutch of circumstance  i have not winced nor cried aloud. under the bludgeonings of chance  my head is bloody  but unbowed   priyanka gandhi vadra tweeted from   th century english poet william ernest henley s celebrated poem invictus on    november  remembering her grandmother indira gandhi on her birthday.the bjp can t grudge them their bravado and optimism. after haryana and maharashtra  they are now looking at jharkhand  hoping

how the spg act destroyed the congress party
text size  a  a perhaps the oldest occupant of a lutyens  bungalow is sonia gandhi. her    janpath bungalow was allotted first to rajiv gandhi as ex pm in       and then to her even for all the years she was in political exile  and she continues to occupy the same address that has become synonymous with power.she has never had to move out of    janpath whether her party wins or loses elections  whether she is the congress president or not. this is unlike other lutyens  bungalows whose occupants frequently move in and out  as per the wishes of the people of a vast country.in the      bihar assembly elections  the rashtriya janata dal  rjd  won a good number of seats in alliance with the janata dal  united  and the congress party. a member of the rjd told me then that its leader lalu yadav s first thought was to get one of his family members a rajya sabha seat.  he doesn t even have a place to sit in delhi   he said.lalu s daughter misa bharti became a rajya sabha member in     .if you are a politician who wants to be taken seriously  you seek to have a  sarkari bangla   a government owned bungalow in delhi. if not a bungalow  even a flat will do. at least it will have a powerful sounding address. these official residences become large offices where political deals are struck and political patronage is dispensed.the other thing many politicians desire as part of their lifestyle is a  gunner   a policeman with a conspicuous gun. in the hindi heartland  the rise and fall in the political fortunes of a leader are visible through the amount of security they have. let s say the government of the day is threatened by a pesky ally  and it desperately needs the support of an independent mla  the independent mla will immediately get a  gunner . if they already have one  they might get another. the threat perception depends upon political necessity.and one more thing   an suv. in uttar pradesh  it is said that you become a politician when you acquire an suv.we are

power. when a politician goes out of power  their worst nightmare is to lose these trappings of power. from time to time we see news headlines about how former mps  mlas and ministers refuse to vacate their official residences  sometimes for years. the courts have quashed laws in up and bihar that entitle former chief ministers and deputy chief ministers to hold on to their posh bungalows.over time  these trappings of power become a personal motivation for politicians to win elections. no amount of money  in white or black  can get you these symbols. you can buy a car  but not a sarkari one. a humble flat in central delhi s south avenue will speak more for you as a politician than a farmhouse on mg road. this memorable account of amar singh leaving his lodhi estate bungalow will tell you what it feels like for a politician to lose their sarkari accommodation. it feels like being at the receiving end of a revolution. you have been dethroned. you are no longer king.these trappings of power are a matter of honour. losing them is dishonour.also read  let us hope amit shah puts the entire opposition in jailthe sun will never setin the case of the first family of the congress party  the gandhis  it is different.the arrogance of the congress party comes from the idea that the sun can never set on their empire. even if they just sit home and do nothing  the people of india will turn to the congress when they get fed up with whoever is in power. this idea is reinforced by the fact that mother  son and daughter have a posh lutyens  bungalow by virtue of being spg protectees.through a law meant to protect their security  they made sure they will forever have the trappings of power at public expense. this includes priyanka gandhi  who has never held any public office. she only pays nominal rent for it.they have  or rather had for all these years  a fleet of high security bmw  mercedes and range rover cars to travel in and an ambulance behind them  just in case. and they had the same security cover as the prime minister of india.there may or may not be good security reasons for them to have had spg cover for    continuous years. after all  the vp singh government hadn t extended rajiv gandhi the spg cover after he lost his prime ministership  and he was assassinated. and the congress party pointed out that to the narendra modi government very recently.but that is not the point here. even if threat perception demands spg cover for the gandhi family  its privileges have helped isolate them from that feeling of being dethroned. whether they won or lost elections  it made sure little changed for them. they were still exempted from being frisked at airports and could ignore questions from the press. they have lived in the same posh lutyens  bungalows forever. they never get to personally experience what loss of power feels like to other politicians.that s how the spg act helped destroy the congress party. by giving its first family the illusion that the sun will never set on the empire. now that their spg cover has been removed  they will be frisked at airports like commoners. priyanka gandhi might lose her bungalow  perhaps forcing her to get herself a rajya sabha seat.also read  sonia  rahul and priyanka gandhi stripped of spg cover  get z plus cover insteadsuccess is the best revengeif and when sonia gandhi steps down as congress president  her    janpath address could be threatened. this might jolt her into realising that establishing her son s career should not be her only priority. there have already been hints that rahul gandhi may lose his    tughlaq lane bungalow for a relatively smaller one.both inside and outside parliament  the congress party is protesting the withdrawal of the spg cover for the gandhi family more vociferously than they are protesting about the economic slowdown  air pollution or even the incarceration of two senior congress leaders on corruption charges.if the only thing the congress party cares about is the spg privileges for the gandhi family  then this is the thing that could jolt them out of the slumber  their meditative inaction  their unwillingness to do the job of the opposition and put the government on the mat and check its excesses.perhaps the congress party is right that the modi government s decision is political vendetta   though the modi government wouldn t take the risk of doing this if security assessment demanded spg cover. they wouldn t want to be blamed like v.p. singh. there s no need to panic  the z  crpf security cover is pretty elaborate and arguably offers more than the threat perception demands.yet  if it seems like political vendetta to the congress  they better realise that success is the best revenge. if the gandhi family does not want to be frisked at airports  they should stop abdicating their responsibilities as the main opposition party. they should have the hunger to fight to win every single election.if the downgrade from range rovers to tata safaris of      vintage feels like a humiliation for the gandhi family  they should know it s a reflection of their dwindling power. and power comes from the people. as the economy tanks and india becomes a de facto hindu rashtra and kashmir remains in lockdown  the congress party keeps perpetually postponing its promise to hold public protests.modi and shah don t think they would ever be humiliated like this because they think they will never go out of power. why don t sonia  rahul and priyanka prove them wrong views are personal.subscribe to our

aaditya thackeray gets away with things that rahul gandhi can t
text size  a  a aaditya thackeray is just    years old but has already outdone his father and maharashtra cm uddhav thackeray  uncle raj thackeray and grandfather bal thackeray by being the first thackeray to contest and win an assembly seat. often seen driving around mumbai in his bmw that apparently cost just rs  .  lakh because  of course  the thackerays are so hard pressed to accumulate wealth that they buy second hand cars  aaditya thackeray is the new young gun in maharashtra politics who isn t playing by the rules.in a parallel world  imagine congress leader rahul gandhi going on a night out with a young and good looking bollywood actress. news channels would ve gone into a tizzy. anchors would ve snapped their veins by shouting at the audience to look at the gandhi brat painting the town red with an actress. they would ve declared rahul unfit for politics and guffawed at his audacity. media would ve announced his nikaah or christian wedding  whichever religion works better for your imagination or hatred  since his janeu has been dismissed by half of india s population. rahul gandhi would ve been the butt of all jokes.also read  shiv sena s aaditya thackeray won t be cm  but he is teaching congress a lesson in politicsa sobo boy  not a political leaderbut aaditya thackeray seems unapologetic about his life. he has been spotted with actress disha patani and seems unaffected by people s opinion.this is also perhaps why no one is taking him seriously in politics  which is all about perception. and aaditya thackeray s image so far is of a boy who is being pitched for a man s responsibility he isn t capable of undertaking yet. sounds familiar  it s no surprise that home minister amit shah refused to give in to shiv sena chief uddhav thackeray s demands of making his son aaditya  and not bjp s devendra fadnavis  the cm. in fact  ncp congress too didn t really warm to this suggestion and pushed uddhav thackeray  the once reluctant son of former shiv sena supremo bal thackeray  to become the cm.aaditya thackeray brandishing a bracelet studded with     diamonds is everything that an indian politician shouldn t do. having written a book of poems and penned lyrics for a private music album  aaditya thackeray is just another boy that fits the sobo culture rather than maharashtra s legislative assembly.also read  this is what uddhav thackeray s cm rule will mean for ncp  congress   bjpwe are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowvibrant nightlife activistit s only fair that uddhav thackeray hustled so hard for his son because he had rahul gandhi s example in front of him. after all  rahul s political journey is more a warning than a model for others.if rahul s career would ve started in       he wouldn t be struggling to create support for himself today as a national leader. he even lost amethi to bjp s smriti irani. that s how much rahul gandhi s image has cost him. the burberry jacket wearing gandhi scion has got everything on a silver platter. aaditya thackeray fits the same bill  which is why aaj tak s anjana om kashyap was heard calling him shiv sena s rahul gandhi on a live show.consider yourself warned  aaditya. it doesn t take long for youth to be dismissed in india s geriatric politics. we forgive the old netas for much more and are less generous toward the young.but then  aaditya thackeray is quickly reinventing how young politicians can appeal to the youth      per cent of india s demography. aaditya has been instrumental in pushing for a better nightlife in mumbai by allowing later hours and lighter restrictions for people to party. with the example of new york and london  he pitches the idea of a vibrant nightlife for a better economy. it can t get more millennial than that.however  aaditya thackeray s politics isn t without irony. he spoke against the cutting down of aarey forest trees for a metro car shed while his party shiv sena was in the very government and the brihanmumbai municipal corporation  bmc  that was instrumental in felling the trees.also read  not amit shah nor pawar  history s chanakya was more than just an indian machiavellipractising secularism for a changebut perhaps aaditya s  yuppie ness  is the makeover the party needed. actually  this is a contrast to rahul gandhi and the congress party s image. rahul needed to show he is aam aadmi and shed his  yuppie ness  by doing mgnrega labour work years ago and sleepovers in rural homes. but all that aaditya needs to do is show he is not a violent vandaliser of cinema halls and shops.in the run up to the      maharashtra assembly election  we saw the shiv sena once again play the hindutva card by demanding the ram mandir in ayodhya. however  the party made the biggest mistake here. shiv sena has been the party of the  marathi manus    the guys who beat up biharis and  up ke bhaiyas  in maharashtra to show them who is the boss. by turning to hindutva  sena strayed away from the marathis.now  maharashtra only had to choose between a regional party offering hindutva and a national party offering hindutva. no one can beat the bjp at hindutva  which is why shiv sena would ve been defeated after this election  even if it was in the government this term.the shiv sena  though reportedly reluctant initially  now stands by a common minimum programme that claims to uphold  secular  values. this is a first for the shiv sena since it was founded in      because it has never been secular.but then it has promised jobs for local people  and with that  the shiv sena has once again brought the marathi people at the centre of its agenda and set it itself apart from the bjp. no  shiv sena is no longer just maharashtra s  bjp lite .also read  shiv sena was hated by indian liberals as extremist hindutva party. now

if bjp leaders could speak like rahul bajaj  this is what they would tell modi   amit shah
text size  a  a industrialist rahul bajaj has earned the admiration of union ministers  parliamentarians and even leaders of the bharatiya janata party with his latest remark. people are scared of speaking up against the narendra modi amit shah government because it won t be appreciated  the bajaj group chairman said bluntly at the economic times  et awards      saturday.the bjp  might have applauded rahul bajaj  though quietly. now that shah has clarified  kisi ko darne ki koi zaroorat nahi hai  no one needs to fear    some bjp leaders may gather enough courage one day to break what

recent reverses in assembly elections do not reflect on the popularity and competence of the two leaders.as results in rajasthan  madhya pradesh and chhattisgarh last year and in the lok sabha elections this year showed  people vote separately for the assembly and national elections. in december       six months after the pokhran nuclear test conducted by atal bihari vajpayee government  the congress formed the government in madhya pradesh  chhattisgarh was carved out of it in       and rajasthan  but the nda returned to power at the centre the next year.in december       the bjp formed the government in those three states but the upa replaced the nda government at the centre five months later. the bjp s loss of power in these states in the november      assembly elections  followed by the party s sweep in all three in lok sabha elections in may       therefore  didn t indicate any new trend.the bjp might have been left high and dry after the shiv sena joined hands with the congress and the ncp to form the government in maharashtra under uddhav thackeray last week  but it doesn t indicate any drastic change in the public s voting preferences. these three parties together had a majority       mlas in the     member assembly   in      too.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and

power  at an election rally in jharkhand last week.the irony was that as he was speaking  the bjp was desperately trying to cobble up a majority in the maharashtra assembly by engineering defections in the ncp and the congress. in its desperation to replace the congress as the only national party with pan india presence in power  the bjp has been borrowing heavily from its principal rival s playbook   using central probe agencies to  neutralise  political opponents  orchestrating defections  horse trading  using constitutional offices to serve political ends and portraying pleas for political morality or propriety as excuses of losers.brand modi was supposed to be the antithesis of such politics. if this brand suffers  no amount of political manipulations  agenda setting or

slowdown may have had no bearing on the voting behaviour of people who continue to repose their faith in modi. but even if the  modi wave  continues  as was evident in the      lok sabha election  the bjp s regional leaders appear to be paying the price for the chinks in people s  faith  in him.manohar lal khattar of haryana and devendra fadnavis of maharashtra were modi s cm nominees who failed to live up to people s expectations. people had voted for them because they believed modi would make sure they deliver. but that unshakeable faith is beginning to get wobbly now.if they were as free as

say that   he added.the bjp parliamentarian may be very optimistic and probably simplistic  but his suggestion could make a good beginning. a total denial of the slowdown  made worse by pm modi s silence  does not seem to be helping the bjp s cause.if they were as free as rahul bajaj  the bjp leaders would tell modi not to be silent like manmohan singh.also read  we are not able to openly criticise modi govt  rahul bajaj to amit shah at et eventopening up to anti modi jokesthe recent assembly election results betray the people s disappointment and disillusionment not with modi himself but with the delivery mechanism he put in place in their states.it s also visible in the form of jokes targeted at pm modi on whatsapp or social media platforms. for instance  a joke doing the rounds on whatsapp nowadays is how residents of a village in karnataka flagged two of their problems to modi when he visited them. the first problem was the absence of any doctor in the village. as the joke goes  modi took out his mobile and called someone. he then told the villagers that the doctor would be available in their village from the next day.  now  what s your second problem   he asked. the villagers responded timidly   sir  there is no mobile network in our area. such jokes may be the handiwork of opposition parties   though i refuse to attribute such wit and humour to them   but their wide circulation against modi is only a recent phenomenon.until recently  such jokes were almost exclusively targeted at congress leader rahul gandhi and other opposition leaders. even those who swear by modi don t mind circulating anti modi jests now. that shows a change among modi loyalists.if they were as free as rahul bajaj  the bjp leaders would like to tell modi shah that the memes and jokes are the first hint of the melting of their carefully constructed persona.there are a number of other things bjp members would want the party leadership to change  be it their involvement in decision making  promotion of regional leaders from state leadership  and choosing talent over loyalty  among others.but they are not losing hope yet. they can rely on the discredited opposition to cover up the failings of governance. as for modi s popularity  here is british music artist rod stewart s      song reason to believe giving voice to the faithful   if i listened long enough to you  i d find a

this is what uddhav thackeray s cm rule will mean for ncp  congress   bjp
text size  a  a the last thing one expected from the dyed in the wool saffron party shiv sena was to ascend to power on two crutches  the congress and the ncp. both the parties have been sworn enemies of the saffron brigade for more than four decades in maharashtra politics.and that is why the shiv sena put up a grand show at shivaji park for the swearing in of uddhav thackeray as the chief minister of maharashtra thursday. it was a sign the hindu hriday samrat balasaheb thackeray s son had to give to the party faithful to assure them that there is no change in the colour of their brand of hindutva in the rainbow coalition.  gained nothing lost everything  is an adage that best applies to him now.while i wish him well  it is unlikely that this regime in maharashtra will last even six months.the shiv sena can savour the moment of borrowed glory  but not for long. the shiv sena ncp congress government may not last long  not because it is a wishful thinking of the bjp. the dynamics of coalition politics does not allow such an artificial alliance to stick together for long. it does not benefit the congress to share power with the shiv sena and squander away its vote bank  or whatever little is left of it. the highly unpredictable nationalist congress party  ncp  too may not like to partner with the shiv sena for too long at the risk of losing its vote share and economic and administrative clout in maharashtra.it would be easier to predict the weather than the twists and turns in maharashtra politics  at least as long as maratha strongman sharad pawar is in command. in the last few days  he has more than once proved that  pawar saheb will always have the last word in government formation in maharashtra .also read  shiv sena was hated by indian liberals as extremist hindutva party. now  it s their darlingdon t underestimate rivalsthere are several key lessons for all the parties in the maharashtra episode.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowthe bjp  it seems  started off on the wrong foot from day one. in the run up to the assembly election  the party s glee over the ed notice to sharad pawar in relation to a scam in a state cooperative bank was hard to miss. however  while speaking to the media  the bjp spokespersons maintained that  ed has taken action as per the procedure .but the maratha strongman was not amused.the bjp then poached one of his trusted lieutenants udayanraje bhosale  got him to resign as an ncp mp and made him contest on a bjp ticket. pawar ensured bhosale tasted defeat.then  the bjp  as a single largest party  foisted pawar s nephew ajit as the deputy chief minister in a coup. in a quick move  pawar fortified his camp and turned the tables on the bjp in less than    hours. the prodigal nephew is back with the ncp  and will eventually be re admitted into the pawar camp.the biggest lesson for the bjp is never to underestimate the strengths  covert and overt  of its political adversaries.the congress was almost written off in maharashtra with no tall leader anywhere in sight. besides  it was evident that the state and central leadership were not on the same page on a number of issues.yet  its alliance with the ncp prevented the splitting of the crucial maratha votes. as a result  both the parties retained and even marginally improved their seat share compared to     .also read  supriya sule was the darling of lutyens  delhi  but is now maharashtra s very own taibjp needs to read new bookspoaching existing leaders from other parties and promoting lightweight non entities will not help the bjp storm the pawar stronghold.the lesson for the bjp is   wait for the right moment but keep building inroads in western maharashtra through confidence building measures. further  the party needs to read some new books on how to keep old friends and win over new ones.the bjp could have roped in both the shiv sena and the ncp to form a new coalition. this would have meant forgoing some important portfolios. but  at this juncture  it was important for the bjp to be in power  especially when elections in jharkhand are around the corner.it should not come as a surprise to the bjp if some of its allies in other states now start contemplating a shift in their position. it may not happen overnight but political realignments can be quick.it is not principles vs pragmatismthe bjp and the shiv sena have always kept their doors wide open to allow free entry of turncoats. nearly half of the current strength of the bjp is made up of  outsiders   who joined the party in      or later for reasons other than ideological.nothing can stop these turncoats to return to where they originally belonged. it is always difficult for a cadre based  ideologically sound party to compromise with principles for the sake of convenience and political expediency. the bjp should know that in politics  principles and pragmatism are not two sides of the same coin. they run parallel.not easy for ncp  congress eitherfor the congress  supporting a shiv sena led government is like trying to remain afloat with an albatross around its neck.it s tie up with the ncp will not allow the congress workers to operate independently in the ncp stronghold constituencies. the party will continue to play second fiddle to the ncp  and now to the shiv sena as well  much to the chagrin of loyal workers.the congress should stop dreaming about a congress ncp merger   pawar will not allow that in maharashtra although he is aware that the ncp s pan india reach is limited.but the ncp too is a one man army. the party has no second rung leadership  cadre base or ideological moorings. it has its origin in an ego clash between pawar and former congress president indira gandhi. the many layers of agricultural economic outfits  sugar cooperatives and rural banks that sharad pawar has built may not operate as a political bulwark for long.aware of the constraints  pawar himself has suggested that it is time for the revival of the congress but has advised the gandhi family not to take the leadership issue for granted.maharashtra politics has shown that every party has many arrows in its quiver.

whether it s cm fadnavis or cm thackeray  the only winner in maharashtra is rahul gandhi
text size  a  a rahul gandhi had reasons to celebrate saturday evening. nationalist congress party chief sharad pawar s nephew  ajit pawar  had saved the day for all dynasts in indian politics by supporting the bharatiya janata party in maharashtra. imagine the implications of the congress coming to power in a state despite the nehru gandhi family having played virtually no role in the election campaign   while sonia gandhi and priyanka vadra stayed away  rahul gandhi addressed barely half a dozen rallies in both haryana and maharashtra. it would be a blow to all political dynasties. it was already bad enough that the congress had put up a creditable resistance in the two states after the party s first family abandoned the fight  hoping to teach its veterans a lesson in defeat.the election results were especially shocking to rahul gandhi. he hasn t said a word on the poll outcome in the past one month  not to speak of congratulating party veterans on turning things around. have you seen or heard of a leader who goes into a sulk because his party has done well in the elections rahul gandhi s trusted lieutenant k.c. venugopal  who ran away from the electoral fray in the      lok sabha election  echoed his boss s sentiments as he opposed a tie up with the shiv sena. but the fear of large scale defections in the party  more than the temptation to keep the bjp out of power in india s most industrialised state  prevailed over sonia gandhi s motherly instincts  she gave a go ahead for talks with the shiv sena.whatever the outcome of the perceived or genuine rift in pawar family  rahul gandhi can now claim the moral high ground. the former congress president will be the winner  regardless of whether the chief minister s post in maharashtra goes to bjp s devendra fadnavis or shiv sena s uddhav thackeray.if fadnavis manages to prove his government s majority on the floor of the state assembly  as and when it comes to that depending on the supreme court s decision monday  congress veterans should brace themselves for a massive assault from rahul gandhi s lieutenants   how could you  destroy  our secular credentials by agreeing to ally with the shiv sena    rahulji   to them  personifies the party s secular ideology  he wears a janeu  visits temples  and went to kailash mansarovar just as he vowed to scrap triple talaq law  made alleged defamatory remarks against the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh  rss  and respected but didn t  welcome  the supreme court s ayodhya verdict. these veterans would have a lot of explaining to do why they shouldn t be exiled to the island of saint helena for damaging rahul s secular image.in the congress  eventual defeat in the current political tussle in maharashtra  therefore  lies the former party

pleased  as johnson  the   th century poet critic  noted. but the political theory of victory by default seems to pervade a large section of the opposition camp today.rahul s tenure as an  active politician    given that he makes only guest appearances in india nowadays   was known for ideological confusion  political pusillanimity  and near stasis. it s no different for his contemporaries in indian politics. every time they are required to make bold political and ideological statements  they take refuge in literary couplets and poems to hedge their insecurity and confusion. after the supreme court delivered its verdict on ayodhya title dispute and the bjp went to town claiming credit for it  samajwadi party leader akhilesh yadav reacted with a couplet on twitter   jo faisle faaslon ko ghatate hain  wo insaan ko behtar insaan banate hain  decisions that reduce distances make human beings better .  one can only surmise that he wanted muslims to accept the decision but wouldn t say it in as many words.tejashwi yadav of the rashtriya janata dal  rjd  expressed his  respect  for the supreme court s decision  adding   every temple  mosque  gurudwara and church in the country is ours only sab apne hain.  they were all taking the congress line  expressing respect for the verdict but not welcoming it with the hope of pleasing both hindus and muslims.like rahul gandhi  both yadavs  expected to lead the resistance against the bjp in uttar pradesh and bihar  have been running their politics through their twitter handles  with the public as well as their parties  rank

recent attack on mp asaduddin owaisi of the aimim betrayed her frayed nerves. she is trying to retain her muslim vote bank without antagonising hindus. one can find many faults with her politics.but while mamata is doing what she does best  the main credit goes to the bjp  which has been relentlessly changing the goalpost for opposition players. they have been left huffing and puffing in trying

how the spg act destroyed the congress party
text size  a  a perhaps the oldest occupant of a lutyens  bungalow is sonia gandhi. her    janpath bungalow was allotted first to rajiv gandhi as ex pm in       and then to her even for all the years she was in political exile  and she continues to occupy the same address that has become synonymous with power.she has never had to move out of    janpath whether her party wins or loses elections  whether she is the congress president or not. this is unlike other lutyens  bungalows whose occupants frequently move in and out  as per the wishes of the people of a vast country.in the      bihar assembly elections  the rashtriya janata dal  rjd  won a good number of seats in alliance with the janata dal  united  and the congress party. a member of the rjd told me then that its leader lalu yadav s first thought was to get one of his family members a rajya sabha seat.  he doesn t even have a place to sit in delhi   he said.lalu s daughter misa bharti became a rajya sabha member in     .if you are a politician who wants to be taken seriously  you seek to have a  sarkari bangla   a government owned bungalow in delhi. if not a bungalow  even a flat will do. at least it will have a powerful sounding address. these official residences become large offices where political deals are struck and political patronage is dispensed.the other thing many politicians desire as part of their lifestyle is a  gunner   a policeman with a conspicuous gun. in the hindi heartland  the rise and fall in the political fortunes of a leader are visible through the amount of security they have. let s say the government of the day is threatened by a pesky ally  and it desperately needs the support of an independent mla  the independent mla will immediately get a  gunner . if they already have one  they might get another. the threat perception depends upon political necessity.and one more thing   an suv. in uttar pradesh  it is said that you become a politician when you acquire an suv.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowalso read  no spg cover  sonia gandhi now enters parliament just like any other mppersonal motivationsarkari residence  security guard  the right car   these are the symbols of power. when a politician goes out of power  their worst nightmare is to lose these trappings of power. from time to time we see news headlines about how former mps  mlas and ministers refuse to vacate their official residences  sometimes for years. the courts have quashed laws in up and bihar that entitle former chief ministers and deputy chief ministers to hold on to their posh bungalows.over time  these trappings of power become a personal motivation for politicians to win elections. no amount of money  in white or black  can get you these symbols. you can buy a car  but not a sarkari one. a humble flat in central delhi s south avenue will speak more for you as a politician than a farmhouse on mg road. this memorable account of amar singh leaving his lodhi estate bungalow will tell you what it feels like for a politician to lose their sarkari accommodation. it feels like being at the receiving end of a revolution. you have been dethroned. you are no longer king.these trappings of power are a matter of honour. losing them is dishonour.also read  let us hope amit shah puts the entire opposition in jailthe sun will never setin the case of the first family of the congress party  the gandhis  it is different.the arrogance of the congress party comes from the idea that the sun can never set on their empire. even if they just sit home and do nothing  the people of india will turn to the congress when they get fed up with whoever is in power. this idea is reinforced by the fact that mother  son and daughter have a posh lutyens  bungalow by virtue of being spg protectees.through a law meant to protect their security  they made sure they will forever have the trappings of power at public expense. this includes priyanka gandhi  who has never held any public office. she only pays nominal rent for it.they have  or rather had for all these years  a fleet of high security bmw  mercedes and range rover cars to travel in and an ambulance behind them  just in case. and they had the same security cover as the prime minister of india.there may or may not be good security reasons for them to have had spg cover for    continuous years. after all  the vp singh government hadn t extended rajiv gandhi the spg cover after he lost his prime ministership  and he was assassinated. and the congress party pointed out that to the narendra modi government very recently.but that is not the point here. even if threat perception demands spg cover for the gandhi family  its privileges have helped isolate them from that feeling of being dethroned. whether they won or lost elections  it made sure little changed for them. they were still exempted from being frisked at airports and could ignore questions from the press. they have lived in the same posh lutyens  bungalows forever. they never get to personally experience what loss of power feels like to other politicians.that s how the spg act helped destroy the congress party. by giving its first family the illusion that the sun will never set on the empire. now that their spg cover has been removed  they will be frisked at airports like commoners. priyanka gandhi might lose her bungalow  perhaps forcing her to get herself a rajya sabha seat.also read  sonia  rahul and priyanka gandhi stripped of spg cover  get z plus cover insteadsuccess is the best revengeif and when sonia gandhi steps down as congress president  her    janpath address could be threatened. this might jolt her into realising that establishing her son s career should not be her only priority. there have already been hints that rahul gandhi may lose his    tughlaq lane bungalow for a relatively smaller one.both inside and outside parliament  the congress party is protesting the withdrawal of the spg cover for the gandhi family more vociferously than they are protesting about the economic slowdown  air pollution or even the incarceration of two senior congress leaders on corruption charges.if the only thing the congress party cares about is the spg privileges for the gandhi family  then this is the thing that could jolt them out of the slumber  their meditative inaction  their unwillingness to do the job of the opposition and put the government on the mat and check its excesses.perhaps the congress party is right that the modi government s decision is political vendetta   though the modi government wouldn t take the risk of doing this if security assessment demanded spg cover. they wouldn t want to be blamed like v.p. singh. there s no need to panic  the z  crpf security cover is pretty elaborate and arguably offers more than the threat perception demands.yet  if it seems like political vendetta to the congress  they better realise that success is the best revenge. if the gandhi family does not want to be frisked at airports  they should stop abdicating their responsibilities as the main opposition party. they should have the hunger to fight to win every single election.if the downgrade from range rovers to tata safaris of      vintage feels like a humiliation for the gandhi family  they should know it s a reflection of their dwindling power. and power comes from the people. as the economy tanks and india becomes a de facto hindu rashtra and kashmir remains in lockdown  the congress party keeps perpetually postponing its promise to hold public protests.modi and shah don t think they would ever be humiliated like this because they think they will never go out of power. why don t sonia  rahul and priyanka prove them wrong views are personal.subscribe to our

shiv sena  ncp and congress are walking into an amit shah trap in maharashtra
text size  a  a after breaking his conspicuous silence on government formation in maharashtra  bjp chief and home minister amit shah said  among other things   if the sena thinks it can revolt and get the people s sympathy  they really don t know the public .between the four main parties in maharashtra  the bjp is the only one  which seems to be thinking of public perception. and  politics is all about public perception.after the maharashtra assembly election results on    october  the shiv sena took a maximalist position as people often do to invite a negotiation. it demanded an equal share of power  including having a shiv sena chief minister for half the term.for many days  speculation was rife that the shiv sena would eventually settle for the deputy chief minister s chair  along with a few plum portfolios. but the experts were soon proved wrong  as the shiv sena s talks with sharad pawar s nationalist congress party  ncp  turned serious.it s now clear that bjp chief and home minister amit shah refused to negotiate  leaving the task to devendra fadnavis. all that was needed was for amit shah to visit matoshree  the shiv sena family home in bandra  and assuage the thackeray ego. that is how he had sealed the lok sabha pre poll alliance with the pesky ally.for days after the    october results  the media kept speculating when amit shah would visit matoshree.  in a peace move  amit shah may visit sena chief at matoshree   said one headline.  talks only if amit shah visits matoshree  sena   said another.but amit shah stayed put in delhi  leaving the shiv sena with no

about how money is a big factor in maharashtra politics  how it is one of the richest states and losing it is a setback for the bjp only strengthen the case that the shiv sena ncp congress are coming together for a corruption merry go round.it would be disastrous for the congress s already poor image to support a party like the shiv sena  known for its history of communal violence. but congress mlas want to join this government  it is being said  and not just support it from outside. why should they not have their share of the spoils if the bjp is made to sit in the opposition  along with two aimim mlas  despite being the single largest party in the maharashtra assembly  it will seem like a setback for the party. but remember that amit shah has had ample time to prevent this  and has chosen not to.if this government is formed  as seems imminent now  the question is how long will it survive. there will be constant bickering and nagging. sanjay raut will continue to entertain us with spicy saamana editorials. sharad pawar will continue to be a man of intrigue. the desperate congress party will do whatever it can to save its dhoti in the mumbai floods until it falls into a manhole.it will likely be karnataka redux. when the congress and the janata dal  secular  managed to form the government against all odds in karnataka  it was seen as a great tactical victory against the bjp. a defeat for amit shah. what came out of it  the bjp swept the lok sabha polls in karnataka anyway  and the congress mlas ditched the ship to enable the bjp s return to power in the state.also read  panga with sharad pawar has cost the bjp dearly in maharashtraanti bjpisman alliance of two couldn t survive in karnataka. here  it is a khichdi of three in maharashtra.let us presume they manage to complete the term. that will give the bjp a good five years to play opposition  slap corruption allegations on all three parties  with more than a little help from the cbi  the ed  the cbdt and other allies.the bjp will use this time to expand the party to try and win the      elections in the state on its own  both lok sabha and vidhan sabha.if the government falls   or there is no government formation and president s rule gives way to snap polls   that s even better for the bjp. it will be able to tell the public  look  these are the people responsible for the political instability. look at these greedy people denying the bjp the people s mandate.in indira gandhi s time  opposition politics came to be known as anti congressism. it didn t succeed  and succeeded only briefly when indira gandhi s regime carried out mass sterilisation drives.like anti congressism  the anti bjpism of drawing room opposition leaders won t succeed because they think politics is about negotiations in the corridors of power  about who gets what portfolio.this unnatural  unholy  unviable alliance will only help the bjp  in maharashtra as well as nationally  because politics is about public perception and public perception alone.that is how the bjp may be able to finish off the shiv sena in just a few years.  some say  this is also amit shah s strategy to weaken devendra fadnavis.

chosen not to.if this government is formed  as seems imminent now  the question is how long will it survive. there will be constant bickering and nagging. sanjay raut will continue to entertain us with spicy saamana editorials. sharad pawar will continue to be a man of intrigue. the desperate congress party will do whatever it can to save its dhoti in the mumbai floods until it falls into a manhole.it will likely be karnataka redux. when the congress and the janata dal  secular  managed to form the government against all odds in karnataka  it was seen as a great tactical victory against the bjp. a defeat for amit shah. what came out of it  the bjp swept the lok sabha polls in karnataka anyway  and the congress mlas ditched the ship to enable the bjp s return to power in the state.also read  panga with sharad pawar has cost the bjp dearly in maharashtraanti bjpisman alliance of two couldn t survive in karnataka. here  it is a khichdi of three in maharashtra.let us presume they manage to complete the term. that will give the bjp a good five years to play opposition  slap corruption allegations on all three parties  with more than a little help from the cbi  the ed  the cbdt and other allies.the bjp will use this time to expand the party to try and win the      elections in the state on its own  both lok sabha and vidhan sabha.if the government falls   or there is no government formation and president s rule gives way to snap polls   that s even better for the bjp. it will be able to tell the public  look  these are the people responsible for the political instability. look at these greedy people denying the bjp the people s mandate.in indira gandhi s time  opposition politics came to be known as anti congressism. it didn t succeed  and succeeded only briefly when indira gandhi s regime carried out mass sterilisation drives.like anti congressism  the anti bjpism of drawing room opposition leaders won t succeed because they think politics is about negotiations in the corridors of power  about who gets what portfolio.this unnatural  unholy  unviable alliance will only help the bjp  in maharashtra as well as nationally  because politics is about public perception and public perception alone.that is how the bjp may be able to finish off the shiv sena in just a few years.  some say  this is also amit shah s strategy to weaken devendra fadnavis.

data shows upper caste voters of both bjp and congress support core hindutva issues
text size  a  a the prominent view among the indian commentariat following the supreme court s ayodhya verdict last week was this  voters don t care  and we should all move on.political commentators like to remind the public that indian voters don t really care about religion.  development   they say  is the only issue on the voters  minds and they don t care about  that mandir masjid stuff . voters certainly give that impression. after the      lok sabha election  voters said in a post poll survey that development and unemployment were the top issues for them at the time of voting. key  hindutva  issues like cow slaughter and ram mandir in ayodhya were barely on their minds  they said.but forming an opinion based on these responses alone is naive at best. what s more likely is that while voters do care about the material improvements  they re voting for parties based far more on ideological lines. after all  most political parties in india do promise development  the congress led upa did a better job on employment than narendra modi led bjp in its first term. despite the common refrain that  they re all the same   the key political antagonists in india are not the same on ideological lines  particularly religion.in their book  ideology and identity  the changing party systems of india  published in       political scientists pradeep chhibber and rahul verma demonstrated that indian political parties and voters are strongly and consistently ideological. as part of the book s quantitative work  they constructed an index of  the politics of recognition   which looked at voter responses to questions relating to key issues of identity in successive rounds of post election national election studies conducted by the lokniti programme of the centre for the study of developing societies  csds .also read  why and how ideology is central to winning elections in indiathe surveys asked voters for their views on the banning of cow slaughter  religious conversion and other key  core hindutva  issues  among other questions. chhibber and verma then coded these responses to determine whether congress and bjp voters were ideologically dissimilar.the survey results are stark  bjp voters systematically supported such core hindutva issues  while congress voters systematically opposed them  although their opposition was far weaker than that of left supporters .we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowthis trend has not changed with time  to argue then that voters in india do not care about religious hot button issues would be disingenuous  given that their positions on these issues are strong and consistent over time  and firmly aligned with one party or the other.among bjp voters  all groups support these issues  which  in        the most recent year for which detailed csds data is available   included  for instance  that the government should not make special provisions to accommodate minorities   except their negligible muslim support base.also read  ram mandir s done  now modi can t ride more hindu nationalism as economy is stallingamong congress voters  on the other hand  all groups opposed these core hindutva issues  except their small upper caste voter base   congress and bjp upper caste voters were virtually indistinguishable on this count.since the first term of the modi government  while older  core hindutva  issues  including the banning of cow slaughter and religious conversion  forcefully integrating kashmir with the mainland through the scrapping of article      and building a ram mandir in ayodhya have been revived  the bjp has also come up with newer core hindutva  .  issues. top among these is the citizenship amendment bill  passed by the   th lok sabha  but not taken up by the rajya sabha  and sent to a joint committee of parliament  that seeks to grant citizenship to non muslim illegal immigrants.hindus were more likely to support than oppose the bill  while muslims were more likely to oppose it. the intersection between religious partisanship and political partisanship on these issues is clear. in assam  for instance  where illegal immigration and its intersection with religion is a particularly charged issue  hindus who supported this bill overwhelmingly voted for the bjp.just as it is disingenuous to say that voters do not care about core hindutva issues  another common refrain of the commentariat is equally hollow   that young people in india do not care about these issues.surveying only millennials  aged        in       a survey found that hindu youth strongly opposed the consumption of beef  for instance  as did bjp supporting young people.also read  can ayodhya ram mandir work for bjp in states when pm modi didn t the voters of the future may say that they are electing leaders for jobs alone  but the revealed preferences of indian voters have always been apparent.the author is a chennai based data journalist. views are personal.subscribe to our channels on

shiv sena  at loggerheads with bjp  can t align with ncp  congress. it will be self harming
text size  a  a the current political stalemate in maharashtra can make anyone cynical about where the state s politics is headed. it is a perfect case study for applying game theory.the bharatiya janata party  bjp  said sunday it won t form the government in maharashtra at present because its ally shiv sena has  disrespected the mandate   in what appeared to be an admission that it couldn t reach an agreement with the uddhav thackeray led party. chandrakant patil  maharashtra bjp president  said his party extends  best wishes  to the shiv sena if it wants to go ahead and form the government with the help of the congress and the nationalist congress party  ncp .both the bjp and the shiv sena held separate press conferences last week  accusing each other of deception and breaking trust  which clearly shows that nothing is right between the warring partners.this also shows that everyone who predicted the outcome of the      maharashtra assembly election   a return of the fadnavis led government   has been proven wrong. for now  at least.and so  some of the commentators have turned psychoanalysts  trying to guess who will win the tussle over the cm s seat. from decoding shiv sena chief uddhav thackeray s next step to figuring out whether ncp chief sharad pawar and congress president sonia gandhi would be able to form a government  experts have left nothing to be imagined.the opposition s desire to sideline devendra fadnavis and the bjp s ally shiv sena is so strong that even rivals like the congress and the ncp are contemplating to jointly finalise their future course of action if the current deadlock continues.there are some speculations that a cabal of bjp leaders wants to dislodge devendra fadnavis from his cm s chair. so now the question of  kaun banega mukhyamantri  has become a game of roulette where an unknown wheel will determine the winner.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowalso read  how uddhav thackeray shed his rahul gandhi image to be a shiv sena leader in his own rightmega confusion  game theory on displayintriguingly  maharashtra s politics has become nothing short of a suspense thriller as all major players are keeping their friends and foes on their toes. though pawar met sonia gandhi on   november  it was not clear if they had any agreement. what exactly transpired between amit shah and devendra fadnavis was also kept under wraps. moreover  what sanjay raut  executive editor of shiv sena s mouthpiece saamana  discussed with sharad pawar and what he wrote to ajit pawar on a text message will never be entirely revealed. they were all both friends and enemies at the same time. it was a perfect manifestation of game theory.game theory has been used by mathematicians  economists  and sociologists to determine the most likely outcomes when two or more players are engaged in situations of either competition or cooperation. how game theory operates in human relationships is magnificently illustrated in the famous play by anthony shaffer   sleuth . in the play  later recreated by nobel laureate harold pinter   the relationship between the tormentor and the tormented takes bizarre and even sinister turns. the roles are reversed.in maharashtra s politics  each player has different objectives and is constantly changing his or her partners and rivals. for instance  the bjp and the shiv sena have been allies for nearly three decades. yet the distrust between them is often on full display.from issues like farmers  loan waivers to the construction of mumbai metro rail and one of its parking sheds in the aarey forest  the two saffron allies have on many occasions bitterly confronted each other. in       then sena supremo bal thackeray endorsed sushma swaraj s candidature for the pm s post when narendra modi had not even emerged as the party s preferred pm candidate. the shiv sena s agitation against the jaitapur nuclear power project and the mumbai ahmedabad bullet train project was in contrast to the bjp s position.also read  this is what will happen if no one forms govt in maharashtra todaya love hate relationshipthe bjp and the shiv sena fought the      maharashtra assembly election independently even as they had contested the lok sabha election together just six months before. it was only when the bjp found that it is short of reaching the majority that the two parties came together to form the government. in the      brihanmumbai municipal corporation election that the shiv sena won  they were again rivals while being allies in the state government.like the players in game theory  the bjp shiv sena relationship is either symbiotic or dialectical.  hindutva  seems to be the only factor binding them ideologically.similarly  there are two  friendly  and  unfriendly  congress parties  the indian national congress  inc  and the nationalist congress party  ncp . they too competed against each other in the      maharashtra assembly election despite being allies in the      lok sabha election. the hostility between the two is such that the congress often accuses the ncp of hobnobbing with the bjp. indeed  even the shiv sena has resented the bonhomie between the ncp and the bjp. prime minister narendra modi has publicly said that pawar has been his guru. pawar too reciprocated by giving his  shishya   modi  a grand welcome in his fiefdom of baramati.so in this game  there are two sets of alliance partners who have turned strident enemies. and the most interesting dimension is that the ncp has indicated its willingness to offer support to a shiv sena led government with congress offering outside support.also read  shiv sena says bjp using money power to poach new mlas to form govt in maharashtrashiv sena s difficult choicethe bjp was expecting a landslide victory in the assembly election and had hoped to marginalise the shiv sena. but sena leaders were aware that the game was to  finish  them. so  the sena and the bjp actively sabotaged each other s candidates. however  the assembly election result clearly showed that amit shah s strategies failed  crushing bjp and fadnavis  hopes.as a result  insecurity of defections has shrouded political parties in maharashtra. each party is protecting its mlas  more evident in shiv sena s case  which has huddled all its mlas in a hotel in mumbai.the bjp with its     seats will not be able to form the government unless it has the support of    more mlas. even as there is adequate support among the congress members to side with the shiv sena  some  including the ncp  are demanding that the sena should snap its relationship with the nda.notwithstanding the bravado of sanjay raut  it is unlikely that the sena would quit the nda. and the sena leadership knows well that it can t afford to lose  protection  under the incumbent bjp led central government.uddhav thackeray s shiv sena allying with the ncp and the congress would result in self harm. after all  the sena too grew on the anti congress tide. it s a classic case of the prisoner s dilemma in game theory  where no mla is sure of their own party s colleagues and is either quietly defecting or succumbing to pressure.slide in maharashtra s political ethosafter inviting the bjp to form the government  the maharashtra governor has now set a  .   pm monday deadline for the shiv sena to make its  stand clear .uddhav thackeray can become the chief minister if he is able to assure the governor that he has the support of all ncp and congress mlas. but if the modi government jumps the gun by saying that nobody has the majority  like in jammu and kashmir   then the only option would be the president s rule.would the shiv sena then take to the streets in its well established style  or would it agree to compromise  whichever option the sena takes  it is in danger of losing credibility.whatever course the politics takes in the state  the ethos of maharashtra will not remain the same again. the foundation has cracked  caste alliances have broken  and the maratha hegemony has collapsed. neither the maratha strongman sharad pawar nor rss chief mohan bhagwat would be able to restore the socio political and cultural balance of maharashtra.the author is a former editor and congress member of rajya sabha. views are personal.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis   only you

indian media used to call out congress  abuse of power. now it legitimises lies of bjp rss
text size  a  a as is my weekly habit  i read shekhar gupta s national interest column in theprint published saturday last week. as usual  it was crisp  analytical  precise in its ideation  and laid out a superb analysis of the recently concluded assembly elections in haryana and maharashtra. whether you agree with shekhar gupta or not  his national interest column is usually good food for thought. but even as i reread it to make sure  i couldn t help feeling a deep sense of foreboding. almost as if i had lost something precious. a sense of having been let down when i least expected it. even betrayal if you will. so  i tried to puzzle out why and this is what i found.if anything  shekhar gupta s intellection was brilliant. the pith and substance of his argument is reproduced below in three quotes from his column  then  a voter was convinced india had faced an existential threat from pakistan for seven decades  nobody had done anything about it  and that  prime minister  narendra modi was nailing the problem  with a finality. and that while he would do it mostly by  decisive  deterrent and fearless  military punishment  he was also raising india s global stature to  isolate  pakistan. once enough voters bought into these  they forgot their other  traditional political loyalties and binaries. the rest then followed. pakistan is muslim  it spreads terrorism in the name of jihad  blood thirsty jihadis are a pestilence for the entire world. again  the implicit insinuation was that the threat was pan islamic  indian muslims were not immune  and hindus needed to consolidate. of course  all this would not have worked so well but for the spectacularly efficient distribution of almost rs    lakh crore in visible welfare to the poor  cooking gas  toilets  homes  and mudra loans. i have written and spoken about these often in the campaign weeks. this is as crisp a pr cis of modi and bjp president amit shah s political strategy that you will find anywhere. this is also the political strategy that went awry in the recent elections  failing to deliver the numbers that the bjp was expecting. that it is a pure myth is only to be expected  and remember  all of this happened within    weeks of the scrapping of article     in kashmir  five weeks of  howdy  modi    the talks with donald trump and the speech at unga. add to these the tv spectacle of mamallapuram with xi jinping  p. chidambaram and d.k. shivakumar s arrests  and key ncp leader praful patel s inquisition for an alleged  terror financing link with iqbal mirchi . moreover  the hearings on ayodhya were going on a day to day basis in the supreme court  bringing the issue back into national consciousness. very few commentators have been able to so succinctly capture the failure of this strategy as shekhar gupta does. how could someone like me  vehemently opposed to the bjp rss ideology  not possibly approve this  notwithstanding the failure to mention elusive trade deals  my central proposition therefore is that the winds of nationalism laden with religion will now yield to those of concern over the stalled economy  unemployment and a general malaise and unhappiness. fresh noises and action on pakistan  kashmir and terror will not be able to reverse these. except  in the most unlikely event of a larger armed conflict. having laid out his case  shekhar gupta concludes that voters are no longer mesmerised by the nationalist narrative and will henceforth focus on the economy. he concludes his article with an advisory that says it all.  they  voters  want the return of economic optimism.   optimism   not growth of   per cent plus in gdp.all good writers  like all good tweeters  address their articles tweets to a specific person audience  even if unnamed. you always write with someone in mind  who you think will read your stuff and react in a certain way. this is what gives coherence and logical structure to what you write or tweet. good writing is rarely an abstraction.also read  tough message for modi  political winds are shifting  from nationalism to economy  jobswe are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowshekhar gupta s audienceso  who is shekhar gupta addressing with this piece  your guess is as good as mine but i would say the target audience here is the top policymakers in the bjp rss who craft political strategies. that much is clear from a recap of the bjp rss strategy in the first quote  followed by how it translated in praxis in the second quote  and  having failed  how the policy  according to shekhar gupta  must now focus on the economic instead of rhetoric. you and i are not the audience here. we may or may not read  but this piece is not aimed at our hearts or minds. it is for the elite policymakers  written as a prescription or suggestion   a way out   now that the old strategy has failed.what has shekhar gupta done in the process of his analysis for the laity   you and i   without ever intending to do so  let us look at the three quotes.for    years nothing was done to address the pakistani threat across the border. really  the fact is  jawaharlal nehru and sardar vallabhbhai patel had more or less tacitly agreed that kashmir would go to pakistan. it was maharaja hari singh who thwarted mountbatten s attempts to push him into pakistan s lap. india fought four wars  in the teeth of world opposition  to keep kashmir  and in the process  split pakistan in two in     . modi s decision to scrap the special status of jammu and kashmir through article     pales into insignificance compared to what previous governments accomplished in the face of world opposition  when the us led west was firmly on pakistan s side. and here you have shekhar gupta  quite inadvertently  but nonchalantly  normalising a maliciously false narrative floated by the bjp and the rss to ensnare indian citizens. in shekhar gupta s defense  i would concede that he is merely recapping the rss bjp narrative. fine. but is there any word  anything in the recap  that says it is false  malicious  inaccurate  contrary to history  misleading and wholly inappropriate to use as a narrative  even in a partisan election campaign  leave alone form the bedrock  so to speak  of a national political strategy over six years  what does false  malicious  mendacious propaganda do to the foundations of the polity  how corrosive is this acid to mutual trust and how will we ever mend what it has destroyed  on the other hand  this is straight normalisation of a despicably evil and mendacious strategy  intended or not.there is much more in the first quote that normalises many a heinous feature of the narendra modi government s politics. for instance  how was the welfarism funded before the elections when there was no money for it  clearly  payments to regular government vendors were stopped to pay for the pre election bonanza  which left a king sized hole in the budget and was later made up by dividends and capital transfer from the reserve bank of india  rbi . the present slowdown can be traced to stopped payments. all this stand normalised now as part of realpolitik. the abuse of agencies  mentioned in the second quote  the politics of vendetta  the scrapping of article      the showmanship at houston  the stark failure to get a trade deal  the lies to confuse substance with hype   all stand normalised as if it was politics as usual. intended or not.some of you may think i am being too harsh. in a sense i am. everybody in the media  not just shekhar gupta  in a sense is guilty of the same wholesale normalisation of the most mendacious myths and fabrications of the modi regime. so why single out shekhar gupta  fair point. tell me who to start with  if not your own favourite column also read  if anything can defeat modi  it s the economynormalising  legitimising liesbut more seriously  consider what modi has but us president donald trump lacks  no  it is not the lack of a serious opposition that helps modi  as compared to trump  to dominate the discourse with false narrative and fabricated myths. in a word  it is that rather hard to pin down quality called legitimacy. modi has easy legitimacy  while trump is denied it day in day out by the us media because it refuses to normalise even a single lie by the president. no  it is not normal to lie  it is not normal to use myths instead of history  it is not normal to misrepresent facts  fudge statistics  make false claims  etc. the list goes on but the fact stands that while trump may be president  his aberrant conduct is not normalised  and so he lacks the essential legitimacy to roll all his critics and opponents into a barrel and float it out into the sea. instead  many keep a daily tally of his lies  call him out at every presser  and anybody who can thwart the president has the legitimacy to do so. trump may rave and rant at the media but legitimacy eludes him and he is reminded of it every single day. legitimacy is essential to exercise of power. trump doesn t have it. modi does. why abuse of agencies by the ruling party is not new. congress and others have also misused this power. they too have lied  and adopted unfair means at elections. go back in history. was the congress  abuse of power  its corruption  its lies ever normalised and made legitimate by the media  that is the essential difference between the past and the present. in the past  we called out abuse by default. today  we condone  normalise  overlook  and thus legitimise abuse of power by default. that is a huge change. who has conferred legitimacy to such a process  the media  of which shekhar gupta is the leading light  one of my favourites.so okay  thought leaders like shekhar gupta and the media have been normalising what can never be normalised  and in a manner that is so casual and routine  indeed banal  that it goes almost undetected and uncommented upon. but where does my sense of loss come from who was shekhar gupta addressing and writing for  the top    strategist in the bjp rss. may be some other parts of the elite as well. now  if he was an analyst or a strategist at a think tank  i would say brilliantly done and then walk away. but shekhar gupta is  first and last  a journalist  not a think tanker  strategist  or mythmaker for some political party. and as a journalist  he sees  hears  observes things and events for me  and questions the government on my behalf. he is my agent  i give him agency  as well as the protection he gets from the government  for being my eyes and ears. but where am i in his superb piece  where are my questions for the government  where are my fears and concerns  has shekhar gupta done anything   anything at all   in this piece that reflects his obligations to his readers as a journalist  in which part of the piece has he called out and questioned mendacious narratives  abuse of power  arm twisting  vendetta politics or even pointed out that this is unacceptable  was the congress given such a free pass ever in the past from such scrutiny  this abandonment of the laity  almost as if the voters are just gullible sheep to be herded by the ruling party  is a new phenomenon in journalism. not everybody is guilty  nor to the same degree  but on the whole  the most damaged part of our polity is the media. and intellectuals. and thought leaders.listen to people from the kashmir valley. listen carefully. what are they saying  over and over again  you will find the same complaint   that they have been let down  betrayed  abandoned and orphaned  not so much by the indian state as the indian media. the very people who made their careers on the misery and dilemmas of the kashmiri people were among the first to turn the official narrative against them. this corrosion of trust spills over to everything else in their lives. i am not alone when i say i feel abandoned  and betrayed. there are millions more who are crying out the same and their plight is far more acute than mine. how can you continue to hide behind the facade of a profession that you are no longer able to honour politics today is not normal. in the ideological war unleashed by the rss bjp  the first casualty has been the spirit of the constitution. it has been trampled upon in so many ways that tomes can be written about them. the alternative to it hasn t been codified  nobody knows what the alternative is  or whether it even exists. instead  patently dishonest obeisance is paid to the existing constitution even as it is quietly subverted and shredded. why not ask for a return to honesty  you want a hindu rashtra  so be it. let us see what it looks like  please put it down on a piece of paper and let us debate it in all honesty and vote on it  why this subterfuge  the backdoor intrigues  the doublespeak  the lies  the corrosive distrust  the destruction of institutions  is it too much to ask what exactly do you have in mind in place of the constitution for our future can the media not resolve to ask the bjp to publish such a blueprint of the future that we can debate  is that too much to ask of the media  you sir  shekhar gupta  is that too much to ask  politics is about we  the people. not the politicians. return what belongs to us.we do not know the real identity of the author who tweets as  sonaliranade. we are publishing this

rahul gandhi shouldn t stand in the way of congress  regional leaders like amarinder singh
text size  a  a the haryana and maharashtra assembly election results show that rahul gandhi must not stand in the way of strong and popular regional leaders in the congress party. one such leader is captain amarinder singh  the chief minister of punjab.it s no surprise that rahul gandhi s charisma was bludgeoned to oblivion by the modi magic that has gripped india since     . however  among the leaders of the congress and the opposition  the only one who could never be trolled  dismissed  disrespected or ignored is the heir of the erstwhile maharaja of patiala  captain amarinder singh.the congress has had a history of not allowing regional leaders to play a national role. the gandhi family s hold over the party has acted as a glass ceiling for many charismatic local leaders. this is also why so many regional variants emerged over time   many led by disillusioned leaders from the party. but times are changing. the family doesn t have the political cache that it once had. so  the family can play two roles   one  as a glue of the party  and two  as the talent spotter of the party.haryana s impressive results for the congress party is largely due to bhupinder singh hooda s command over the voters. this holds an important lesson for the party. not all is lost. having been defeated in the      lok sabha elections  it can start making amends now.also read  bhupinder singh hooda fought a two pronged battle  within congress and against bjpthe leader congress didn t give a chancecaptain amarinder singh is one such leader that the congress party missed out on giving a national role. he was the nationalist leader who the congress could ve pitched as a trump card to give competition to the bhartiyata sentiment that propelled narendra modi  who has stirred the idea of a  new  india bordering on jingoism  to the corridors of power. captain amarinder singh speaks nationalism but his style and demeanour are poles apart from narendra modi.amarinder singh has always spoken for the idea of the nation first  which is why he never warmed up to yesteryear cricketer and bjp turncoat navjot singh sidhu who became a little too friendly with pakistan army chief qamar javed bajwa during his visit where he raised the kartarpur corridor case. captain amarinder singh took no time to reprimand sidhu  then cabinet minister  by saying that as someone who has served in the indian army once  he or any indian  will not tolerate anyone hugging the pakistan army chief. we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowthe role of the armed forces during the balakot airstrikes and the resulting tsunami of adulation that pm narendra modi received proved amarinder singh s point. this explains why on the day of the      lok sabha election results  the punjab cm categorically stated that the congress has to pay for navjot singh sidhu s show in pakistan.and it is here that captain amarinder singh scores more points than narendra modi. besides being a seasoned politician  he has served in the army. when he talks for the army and its pride  it s not mere lip service to score brownie points during election season.just like narendra modi  he also fits the bill of an iron fisted leader  who feels right to the people of india since they are constantly reminded of being unfairly occupied by muslims from central asia and then the british. but here too  captain amarinder singh looks more compassionate than narendra modi.after the dilution of article     on   august  it was a leader like amarinder singh who walked a tightrope by aligning with the party line of speaking against the modi government s move in jammu and kashmir. but he had the wisdom to emphasise on the unconstitutionality of the bifurcation of the erstwhile state of jammu and kashmir instead of the removal of the special status. his government went on to ban any protests or celebrations in punjab over this decision. he also hosted kashmiri students living in punjab on eid and established himself as a leader who is sensitive and capable of taking tough decisions.also read  congress should allow local leadership to develop  sachin pilotthe lesson for congressnarendra modi has often been criticised for his acerbic comments on his opponents  for example calling sonia gandhi a  jersey cow   mamata banerjee  speed breaker didi  or calling his dissenters  urban naxals .his critics say such remarks don t behove a prime minister. you ll hardly ever catch singh using an ill willed word against his peers  no matter how bitter the political atmosphere becomes.during the release of the movie avengers  end game  the akalis decided to throw shade at amarinder singh by trending the hashtag  rajeda endgame . in a facebook post  shiromani akali dal claimed that the cm was the  thanos  of punjab and that his  endgame  was imminent.later  food processing industries minister harsimrat kaur badal even blamed him for disrespecting the jathedar of the akal takht  the highest temporal seat of the sikhs  by making a parallel stage to mark the    th  parkash purb . amarinder singh walked away from such insinuations with a simple statement like   she  badal  has no scruples  none of the akalis have. the congress should realise that maintaining strong leadership in the party is central to its success and that a repeat of sonia gandhi nominating anyone from the party  like manmohan singh  as the pm candidate is a cheque that can be cashed only once.india is now only voting for a leader that commands his or her party  whichever it may be. we are no longer voting for the bjp  we are voting for  modi ji .india has a parliamentary election system  but people are voting presidential style. that s the reality the congress must accept.also read  milind deora isn t alone. in post

been ineffective  and was running the party into the ground.congress  which by now was under the charge of sonia gandhi  gave way  but only a little. it made hooda leader of the congress legislative

because the high command was not ceding to his demands  remove ashok tanwar from the post of party s haryana chief and declare him as the cm candidate. hooda maintained that tanwar s leadership had been ineffective  and was running the party into the ground.congress  which by now was under the charge of sonia gandhi  gave way  but only a little. it made hooda leader of the congress legislative party  which empowered him to monitor ticket distribution in haryana.but controversy returned to haunt hooda when a video of colleague ahmed patel allegedly asking him and party s haryana in charge ghulam nabi azad about ticket distribution went viral on   october.it became clear that the congress mandate in haryana would be a testament to hooda s success  or failure.also read  no word from

there is still hope for congress. but first  rahul gandhi must quit politics
text size  a  a rahul gandhi has single handedly weighed his party down  serving as nothing but an albatross around the neck.the only hope for the congress now is to convince the voter that rahul gandhi isn t there at all  and if they vote for the party  they do not run the risk of promoting gandhi.as maharashtra and haryana voted monday in what seems like a definite one sided election  one thing has become clear   rahul gandhi needs to quit politics.for this crown prince  a permanent vanvaas from politics is the only way out to breathe some life into his kingdom.it isn t enough that rahul gandhi  after a while of what can only be described as juvenile sulking  stepped down as party president. that decision seems to have helped nobody  except the bharatiya janata party  bjp  for

do is rake his name up to remind voters of the alternative that stares at them.so disastrous has been his run as the party president that he has ended up being a baggage for the congress   and it is just not able to get rid of him.under rahul gandhi  the congress has faced major electoral losses. his complete lack of voter connect  inadequate understanding of ground politics  a disconnected coterie  poor decision making  a deeply flawed sense of entitlement and misplaced priorities have ensured that the congress is not even considered an opposition in many states now. his own electoral defeat in the family pocket borough of amethi has exposed his reputation as a politician.his ill timed vacations aside  gandhi s most poorly thought out political strategy was to personally target narendra modi ahead of the      lok sabha elections  calling him a  chor   thief  and insisting on mounting a campaign that was bound to fail. he gifted modi the ammunition to target him with   an

forced to work under his shadow  never getting a chance to assert themselves as leaders in their own right. he is  after all  the crown prince  even if he chooses not to sit on the throne. with him

over    per cent vote share in the      lok sabha elections. it is also in power in key states like rajasthan  madhya pradesh and chhattisgarh. but if the congress wants to arrest its slide and

now is the time for the congress to campaign on nyay
text size  a  a before the      lok sabha elections  the congress party felt india needed a universal basic income of sorts. its plan was called nyay  the nyunatam aay yojana. the idea was that no indian family should live on less than rs       a month. if they do  the government must give them the shortfall.the congress lost the election badly and forgot all about nyay. despite projecting it as a dole of rs        a year  nyay failed to win votes for the congress because it was launched with a very poor campaign  just a few days before polling began. ideas take time and effort to spread. even a banal  hollow slogan like  new india       gained currency because prime minister narendra modi used it for two years  from      to       and has now dumped .india s slowdown is arguably the biggest economic crisis since     . lakhs of people have lost their jobs  incomes and wages are stagnating  not leaving people with enough money even to buy essentials like underwear and biscuits.the winter of       even more than the summer of       is ripe for a real nyay campaign. as pm narendra modi claims all is well and india is on its way to becoming a    trillion economy  the congress and the opposition at large could throw him a simple challenge  universal basic income. the challenge could be refined further  give either a job or minimum basic income to every family.  naukri ya nyay

nyay campaign  if undertaken today.also read  if anything can defeat modi  it s the economywe are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism

modi government that gets to set the agenda and the opposition only reacts. what the opposition has to say becomes irrelevant  because the entire conversation becomes about what the government is proposing. can india be a    trillion economy by      or not  should indians be able to buy land in kashmir or not  do we need an all india national register of citizens to identify illegal immigrants or not  should there be a ram mandir at the demolished babri masjid site in ayodhya or not the answer to these questions does not matter  because the questions are framed in a way that all answers benefit the ruling establishment. even if you say india can t be a    trillion economy by       you will end up highlighting that it is what modi is working towards. what is the opposition working towards  no one knows. the upper hand in politics belongs to the one who sets the agenda.a nyay campaign will serve to set the agenda in a way that benefits the opposition. no matter how the modi government responds  it will help the opposition and hurt the ruling party. if the government accepts it  it will be a victory for the opposition. if the government rejects or ignores it  it will look like it doesn t care for the suffering of the poor and those losing jobs. if the government says it is a bad idea  impractical idea  that there isn t enough money to do it and so on  it will make people talk about what the opposition is proposing to improve the lives of indians.also read  congress underestimated modi  cult   nyay was announced too late  shashi tharoorraison d  tresecond  a nyay campaign will give the opposition a cause. rudderless and listless  the opposition desperately needs a reason to justify its existence. if you look at the congress party s non campaign in maharashtra and haryana  you ll see the opposition has given up all hope. the bjp has reached such a dominating peak that the opposition has given up any hope of winning any election any time soon.by campaigning for nyay  the opposition would give itself a cause. the leaders and cadres deserting opposition ranks will see that the opposition parties still have the ability to put up a fight. by waging a do or die battle to get the people of india universal basic income  the opposition could inject some life in itself and come out of coma.trust is everythingthe opposition today suffers from a credibility crisis and a trust deficit among the masses  as the lok sabha election results showed. part of the reason for the failure of nyay in the lok sabha elections was the trust deficit between the congress and a large number of swing voters. there are many reasons for this trust deficit  one of which is that the opposition comes across as being interested in nothing other than winning elections. modi  on the other hand  believes in permanent campaigning  giving the impression that he thinks about people s welfare every single day.the congress party had announced in mid september that it would launch an agitation on economic issues in mid october  but there is no sign of it. how is anyone to take the congress party seriously  not that any of the regional opposition parties are doing any better.a nyay campaign today  leading up to the next budget session in february  will help restore the opposition s credibility before the electorate. it will show the opposition cares about people s suffering due to the economic slowdown and rising unemployment. more importantly  people will see the opposition is not merely criticising the government for rising unemployment but offering a solution to alleviate people s distress. there s no campaign like a positive campaign.also read  what abhijit banerjee and thomas piketty missed in their study of indian voter behaviourcountering

  november to    december  to be extended last minute to clearly bring in some new law without giving prior notice  will see the modi government focus on hindutva and identity politics in order to shift public attention away from the economic slowdown.at such a time  a nyay campaign will help the opposition counter the politics of religious polarisation. the opposition could shift the debate from  do you support ram mandir   to  do you support nyay   the opposition might then walk out not against ram mandir  but against the government s refusal to bring in universal basic income.also read

that farmers voted for modi for rs       a year  but people even poorer than these marginal farmers don t want rs       a month  the failure was of the campaign  not of the idea.a smarter nyay campaign this time should be about going door to door  asking the poor the sign on a nyay petition  building public momentum from the grassroots even if the media ignores the opposition s campaign. such mass movements also make passionate young people join political parties.the fourth benefit of a nyay campaign  therefore  will be to strengthen the opposition s rank and file.views are

rahul gandhi must reflect on why grandmother indira called savarkar a patriot
text size  a  a the ghost of veer savarkar is back to intrude in contemporary politics   this time in the electoral fight in maharashtra  even as the clamour for a bharat ratna for him grows.while the shiv sena has always ardently supported the conferment of india s highest civilian award on savarkar  the bjp too has put its weight behind the claim  with even prime minister narendra modi advocating for it. this has left the congress in more disarray than it normally finds itself in  with extreme reactions from leaders like digvijay singh and manish tewari to a more tempered reaction from former pm manmohan singh.those in the congress abusing savarkar are well advised to take a leaf out of their tall leader indira gandhi s book. after savarkar s demise  she had said   his name was a byword for daring and patriotism. mr. savarkar was cast in the mould of a classical revolutionary and countless people drew inspiration from him.  a stamp was issued in his honour by then government  indira gandhi also donated rs        for a memorial fund and sanctioned the making of a documentary film on him. rahul gandhi needs to then mull over whether his grandmother was eulogising a  traitor    coward  and a man complicit in mahatma gandhi s murder.also read  in his second term  modi govt has moved from deen dayal upadhyaya to veer savarkara revolutionarywhile the decision on the bharat ratna is left to the realm of both politics and speculation  it is a symbolic gesture of acknowledging those alternative voices of our freedom struggle that have been suppressed for the longest time in the zeal to create a monochromatic narrative.as a young man  savarkar established the country s first secret society of revolutionaries the mitra mela  that later became abhinav bharat  and facilitated a fantastic network of revolutionaries across india. way back in       during the partition of bengal  he gave a call for complete freedom  something the congress did only by        and organised the first bonfire of foreign clothes as a student of poona s fergusson college for which he was rusticated by the authorities.later  as a student of law at the gray s inn  savarkar became the nucleus of a vast inter continental  anti colonial armed struggle to free india. with several luminaries such as shyamaji krishnavarma  madame bhikaji cama  sardar singh rana  madan lal dhingra  v.v.s. aiyar  niranjan pal  virendranath chattopadhyay  lala hardayal  m.p.t. acharya and others  he spearheaded many revolutionary acts ranging from procuring and smuggling bombs  pistols and bomb manuals to orchestrating political assassinations of the british. he created a vast intellectual corpus for the revolutionary movement by writing the biography of italian revolutionary joseph mazzini and his magnum opus on the      uprising.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowin fact  it was savarkar who coined the phrase  the first war of indian independence  and wrote on it after extensive research at the british archives from an indian perspective  possibly why home minister amit shah credited him with keeping the memory of      alive.also read  as a teenager  savarkar tried to destroy a mosque   was sad hindus weren t unitedno british stoogethe british were petrified by savarkar s activities and he was classified as a  d  or dangerous criminal. they wanted him extradited to india at all costs and did not mind going the whole hog  even getting into a dispute with france at the international court of justice in hague just to secure his capture. he was given an unfair trial with no jury or appeal and slapped the highest punishment of two transportations of life amounting to    long years in the dreaded cellular jail in the andamans.the inhuman and barbaric tortures that he and several other political prisoners underwent there is a matter of historical record. the bogey of the clemency that he sought is often invoked to discredit him. but these petitions were a normal route available to all political prisoners  including the likes of barin ghose or sachindranath sanyal who availed the same .savarkar was also acting as a spokesperson for other prisoners in his petitions  and several of them talk about seeking a general amnesty for all  especially after the first world war. british officials like sir reginald craddock who interviewed savarkar said that he  cannot be said to express any regret or repentance  for whatever he did. mahatma gandhi himself advised savarkar s younger brother narayanrao to file a petition seeking the release of his elder brothers and built a strong case for them. his letter was also published in young india dated    may       titled  savarkar brothers .savarkar was conditionally released in       but confined to the district of ratnagiri and prevented from taking part in politics initially for five years  later extended to    years. if he had turned a british collaborator  there would have been absolutely no reason for him to be under the strictest surveillance where every move of his was tracked.the plethora of british intelligence reports of the time testify how his speeches and actions were monitored closely. to dodge this and also to put into practice the ideology of hindutva that he envisioned as a response to the pernicious and communal khilafat movement that gandhi had launched  savarkar embarked on massive social reforms and unification of the hindu society.inter caste dining  inter caste marriages  temple entry  complete abolition of the caste system and untouchability were his pet projects at ratnagiri. yet  his work inspired revolutionaries all through.durgadas khanna who later became the chairman of the punjab legislative council was an associate of bhagat singh and revealed in an interview that while being recruited to the hindustan socialist republican association  bhagat singh and sukhdev had asked him if he had read the works of veer savarkar. bhagat singh even got the      book s second edition published. decades later  netaji subhas chandra bose and rash behari bose got japanese editions published. tamil versions of the book were found during the indian national army  ina  raids.also read  savarkar wanted to smash caste system  cooked prawns and didn t worship the cowa nationalistin       after being released  savarkar took over as the president of the all india hindu mahasabha. on the one hand  he countered the congress  abject appeasement policy and on the other  the divisive politics of muhammad ali jinnah and the muslim league. the constitution of free india  according to savarkar was to be one where equal rights and obligations were conferred on all people irrespective of caste  creed  race and religion. he said   the conception of this hindu nation is in no way inconsistent with the development of a common indian nation in which all sects and sections  races and religions  castes and creeds  hindus  muslims  christians  anglo indians could be harmoniously welded together into a political state on terms of perfect equality. we want to relieve our non hindu countrymen of even a ghost of suspicion that legitimate rights of minorities with regard to their culture  religion and language will be expressly guaranteed.   savarkar  hindu rashtra darshan it is a false narrative that he propagated the two nation theory and was a mirror image of jinnah. savarkar opposed the militant groups within the muslim community and alluded that given the imagination of a pan islamic ummah under a common caliph  many muslims did think of themselves as being a separate entity. but he opposed the creation of pakistan or a nation within a nation on religious terms.during the quit india movement that he was opposed to  he encouraged young indians to enlist in the british army and get trained so that they can then defect over to netaji s ina. netaji  in a broadcast on    june      on the azad hind radio  said   when due to misguided political whims and lack of vision  almost all the leaders of the congress party have been decrying the soldiers in the indian army as mercenaries  it is heartening to know that veer savarkar is fearlessly exhorting the youths of india to enlist in the armed forces. these enlisted youths themselves provide us with trained men and soldiers for our ina.  rash behari bose called savarkar  a rising leader of new india  in a japanese magazine dai ajia shugi  march april     . it is a known fact that the naval mutiny of      is what accelerated india s freedom and not so much the      agitations.also read  read this before deciding whether savarkar was a british stooge or strategic nationalistgandhi s assassinationthe long shadow of gandhiji s murder holds on savarkar despite him being exonerated by the court after due consideration of all the evidence in front of it.nathuram godse in his dying declaration expressly mentioned   it is not true that veer savarkar had any knowledge of my activities which ultimately led me to fire shots at gandhiji.  godse  in fact  spoke about getting disillusioned with savarkar s pacifism after      and decided to break away from him. interestingly  the jawaharlal nehru government did not appeal against savarkar s acquittal. the j.l. kapur commission that gave its verdict indicting savarkar posthumously has been challenged by several people  including historians such as sheshrao more  of being a politically fixed report that did not even take into consideration several important witnesses.it is this troubled legacy of savarkar that haunts india even today  especially with his ideological successors being in the political ascendant. hopefully  the bharat ratna would finally lay to rest the soul of this much maligned and misunderstood

meanwhile  may have remained off the radar  but will go down in history for her contribution to dalit politics and social awakening  as well as a term as chief minister  remembered for a controlled law and order situation in a very difficult state.other opposition leaders like andhra pradesh s jagan mohan reddy have also managed reasonably well for themselves in this all powerful modi era  making akhilesh yadav stick out like a sore thumb. besides  of course  his good friend  or once good friend  rahul gandhi.what does akhilesh have to his credit  he is a leader who built no legacy for himself  left no stamp on the style of governance. to make it worse  he seems to be showing no signs of coming out of this post defeat shell.also read  naukri is the new mehngai but the opposition just doesn t get itthe declinegiven uttar pradesh s murky political past and the whole concept of  goondaraj   akhilesh was like a breath of fresh air   but more importantly  he was very unlike his father and former cm mulayam singh yadav and his ever dominating army of uncles.what marked akhilesh yadav s five year term was not a burst of youthful energy in governance  but a massively deteriorating law and order situation  with an overbearing father and his brothers constantly undermining his decisions.after a poor governance record  the      assembly elections in the state were dominated by a very public and ugly spat between father and son in the samajwadi party. akhilesh yadav emerged as a politician in his own right  forcing his father to fall in line. that glory  however  was short lived. a much hyped   up ke ladke   the boys of up  alliance between the sp and the congress materialised  with akhilesh and rahul in the front. the results   disastrous  a drubbing for the alliance and a sweep for the bjp.from a ruling party  the sp it was reduced to a near nothing opposition  with a mere    of the     seats.the bypolls in the state in      gave the opposition  including akhilesh yadav  a reason to smile  but that seemed more like a fluke.the real disaster came ahead of the      lok sabha polls  where an obviously rattled akhilesh and bahujan samaj party head mayawati decided to bury decades old bitterness and use the bua bhateeja  aunt and nephew  cocktail to defang the bjp. this time  the other  up ka ladka  rahul gandhi was kept out  but the results were still as dismal.akhilesh yadav s party managed a mere five seats. by then  ample questions were being raised about this once promising political star s political sense and electoral

been known for. consider the july instance when senior sp leader and serial offender azam khan s sexist statement in lok sabha drew smiles and even a defence from akhilesh.the difference between rahul gandhi and akhilesh yadav is that the latter has always appeared to be far more grounded  less flighty and not a serial bumbler. he has also been more affable and despite the whole  dynasty  tag  far from arrogant. there is also little doubt he is reasonably hard working and does not set off on foreign vacations at inopportune times. however  if he does continue down this path of directionless and

bjp   media s continuing obsession with rahul gandhi only shows that he is still relevant
text size  a  a people love to hate rahul gandhi. when he is doing politics in india  he is ignored. when he leaves the country for a retreat or holiday  the media resurrects him and lampoons him. the bjp and the media can t make up their minds about rahul gandhi. do they miss him or not the extreme range of feelings this single congress politician elicits from indians polarises the entire nation.

leaving the country  barely two weeks before haryana and maharashtra go to the polls on    october.the continuing obsession of the bjp with rahul gandhi  in spite of the modi amit shah duo rubbing his nose in the dust this lok sabha election  only goes to show that rahul gandhi still remains relevant in the country. the deep desire to constantly put rahul in his place with the laser focus on him by

fascination with a nearly    year old european looking man who is still called a  youth leader   who spoke fluently in hindi and shouted  chowkidar  at every crowd he addressed with a thundering  chor hai  response  was real. the crowds responded to him. everyone wanted to touch him  hug him and sometimes even kiss him. he didn t remind anyone of indira or rajiv gandhi  but people knew all too well that he was just    when he lost his grandmother to a tragic assassination and that life jolted him once more when he lost his father to another assassination at   . he was the man who smiled in spite of it.he was also the man who spoke more gandhian than nehruvian in       although the latter could ve helped him more. the mahatma concept of offering the second cheek for a slap was followed by rahul gandhi to a tee. despite narendra modi s savage barbs and insults at rahul and his family  including his dead father  and great grandfather along with his sister  brother in law and mother  rahul stuck to a  love and a huge hug  for  modi ji .and those who love rahul swear by this attitude of his. according to his supporters  he s too good a guy to be in politics. he s the reason the congress party has not lost its way  in spite of the party seeing an imminent slow death.the congress party s stand against the article     move in kashmir was considered by most as a suicidal decision. everyone knew congress would be branded as the party that took  pakistan s stand  when it comes to the kashmir issue. but the gandhis  especially rahul  stuck to calling out the bjp s move as unconstitutional.many leaders in the party like jyotiraditya scindia clearly showed their displeasure and spoke in favour of the bjp s decision since that seemed more nationalistic. but rahul insisted on doing the right thing instead of doing the right thing for the party.also read  not rahul s cheerleader nor priyanka s fall guy   jyotiraditya scindia wants a piece of delhicongress s

be served on a platter to him. even the gandhi stronghold amethi showed how unconvinced they felt about him by giving bjp leader smriti irani a big symbolic win in the election. his main man in amethi  sanjay sinh left the party soon after.rahul s critics are of the firm opinion that he has led the party to its lowest possible position  and that he s unfit for politics. his office is considered high handed wherein those who seek a rendezvous with rahul are asked to email notes on the agenda they want to speak on. and that s not how indian politics works. it isn t a corporation. indian politics is earthy  rooted and based on personal equations  which rahul and his office refuse to understand.rahul s clique of pals is another reason why people think he isn t serious about carving out a place for himself in india s political landscape. plum posts constantly going to the scindias  the pilots and the deoras have alienated the younger karyakartas as not belonging to the political dynasty. in fact  the old guard also feels stabbed in the back for sticking out for so long only to be sidelined by young men who think they know it all. sanjay nirupam is one such relevant maharashtra leader who is currently threatening to leave the party for being sidelined by milind deora who he has called a  nikamma   useless .rahul gandhi s silence during opportune moments is also considered a big failure. while many expected rahul to take to the streets as a karyakarta over kashmir s communication lockdown  india s economic slowdown  rise in petrol and diesel prices  falling

three reasons why sonia gandhi should make one last  supreme sacrifice  for congress  sake
text size  a  a the bharatiya janata party is falling back on the congress yet again to win the assembly elections in maharashtra and haryana.listen to amit shah and other bharatiya janata party  bjp  leaders  election speeches. they are all about the congress   how it took the kashmir issue to british labour party leader jeremy corbyn  how it is opposing the bjp s attempt to drive out infiltrators  and how it  mocked  defence minister rajnath singh for following the indian tradition of  shastra puja  on the rafale fighter jet.it s an irony that five years after it dislodged the congress from power at the centre and in many states  the bjp continues to seek a mandate against the opposition party  and with so much certitude. congressmen can do nothing but curse and squirm. many of them know the way out  but don t have the heart or the guts to spell it out. they know there is just one solution   another  supreme sacrifice  by interim president sonia gandhi  one last time.in       she had plunged into politics to save the congress. in an interview with shekhar gupta for ndtv s walk the talk programme in february       sonia gandhi had talked about how she felt  pangs of guilt  every time she passed by her husband rajiv gandhi s portrait in her living room   that she was not doing enough to revive the congress.a little over two decades later  she may be feeling the same. but she is confronted with a conflict of interests   those of her children and those of the party. the nehru gandhi family must step aside and free the party of its grip. there are three reasons why sonia gandhi must make this  supreme sacrifice  if the congress has to be revived.also read  sonia gandhi message to party   tweeting not enough  more important to fight on the streetwe are deeply grateful

nowthe family is a liabilityfirst  the nehru gandhi family is no more an asset  except for the bjp. the ruling party has successfully made the family synonymous with everything that agitates the public mind today   dynastic politics  corruption  entitlement and inefficiency. how much of it should be attributed to the bjp s propaganda machinery and how much to the congress party s inability to counter it is anybody s guess. but the fact is that every time prime minister narendra modi or home minister amit shah take a jibe at the nehru gandhi family  there are smiles and grins in the audience. those jibes may not always be fair  but people seem to endorse them.addressing a public meeting in maharashtra s sangli thursday  amit shah asked people to end the dynasties of the congress and the nationalist congress party  ncp  in the coming elections.not that the bjp doesn t have dynasts. in maharashtra  veteran leader gopinath munde s daughter  pankaja munde  was made a minister in devendra fadnavis  cabinet and has been given the party ticket again. the bjp denied a ticket to veteran party leader eknath khadse  who had to resign as revenue minister on charges of corruption  but gave it to his daughter rohini. former state bjp chief raosaheb danve s son santosh has been re nominated. in the party s first list     candidates are family members of bjp leaders.in haryana  it has fielded aditya devi lal  grandson of devi lal  and bhajan lal s nephew dura ram bishnoi  among others. the treasury benches in the lok sabha are occupied by many dynasts   maneka gandhi and her son varun  anurag thakur  dharmendra pradhan  and poonam mahajan to name just a few.yet  when modi or shah criticise the congress for promoting dynasts  it s greeted with claps and laughter   as if only the congress has dynasts. but that tells us how the people have grown weary of the nehru gandhi family. as it is  the gandhis can t get votes for the congress any longer.also read  rahul gandhi has taken a backseat  but his team is running congress showfamily s disconnect with the massessecond  the nehru gandhi family members have lost connect with the masses  their feelings  hopes and aspirations. rahul gandhi has been so busy fighting an  ideological  battle with the bjp and the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh  rss  that he has lost sight of the political battle. promising a review of armed forces special powers act  afspa  and sedition laws in the party s      manifesto post balakot airstrikes were tantamount to political suicide  but he wouldn t compromise on his ideological beliefs.he wasn t much impressed by his party colleagues  appeals to respect the public sentiments about the defanging of article     either  as he boarded a flight for srinagar  ostensibly to expose the government s claims of normalcy in the valley. when the uk overseas congress delegation met corbyn to talk about  human rights situation  in kashmir  it was probably trying to please the former congress president. sam pitroda  rahul s close aide  chairs the india overseas congress. gandhi s ceaseless diatribe against the rss may not fetch any extra votes but he must talk about the sangh ad infinitum because the ideological battle must take precedence.it seems to be rubbing off on his party colleagues  too. addressing a gathering in raipur thursday  chhattisgarh chief minister bhupesh baghel berated the rss  saying that the sangh s nationalism is inspired by  hitler and mussolini . my colleague  deeksha bhardwaj  who was covering the event decided to check with the audience what people made of it. they happened to know hitler as  a dictator  but seemed clueless about the italian dictator.  woh bhi goondagardi karta tha  mussolini too was a ruffian    a young man came forward to explain. you can only imagine the dalits  response to rahul gandhi s message to them that they need the  escape velocity  of jupiter to succeed.the family s focus on ideology has somehow resulted in total confusion about everything people would like to hear from the principal opposition party. so  there is radio silence at the congress headquarters when amit shah dares the party to spell out a

haryana cm manohar lal khattar scripts a political turnaround story congress can learn from
text size  a  a there is one political leader who holds out a big lesson for the congress party   haryana chief minister manohar lal khattar  whose political prowess would be put to test as the state votes on    october.after starting off disastrously  which made it look like haryana could be that one state where the bjp would lose its grip  manohar lal khattar is now a turnaround story looking decisively poised to waltz to power   a textbook case of how a mucky situation can be reversed.the    year old bharatiya janata party  bjp  leader   with deep roots in the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh  rss    first became chief minister in     . khattar wasn t the face of the election then  and was chosen to lead the bjp in haryana after the party s handsome victory. the unconventional choice caused a flutter because the bjp of amit shah and narendra modi went for a non jat leader for a state whose politics had been shaped by the dominant jat community for long. this poll season  however  the bjp goes to the hustings with khattar as its unequivocal leader  whose  mano again  war cry takes off from prime minister narendra modi s very successful campaign   namo again .with the congress  particularly the hooda clan  in free fall and no other opposition party coming across as challenging enough  khattar seems set to return as haryana s chief minister. the picture  however  wasn t always this rosy. from a leadership revolt to a violent jat agitation to dera sacha sauda stir  khattar s rule hasn t been without formidable challenges. but as he rode through each crisis thrown his way  the congress in haryana was a study in contrast as it kept devolving.also read  manohar lal khattar s bank balance grew    fold since      but he still doesn t own a carthe turbulent ridemanohar lal khattar was seen as a nobody in the bjp s scheme of things in haryana  and many believed he won the coveted cm post only because of his proximity to modi.not surprisingly  therefore  the first hurdle that he faced was simmering internal revolt. his colleagues  resentment towards him and lack of faith in his leadership only kept rising  leading to an open revolt by    party mlas in     . rebellion continued well into late last year when mlas  including a cabinet minister  spoke out against khattar. the situation was such that bjp president amit shah was forced to step in. but khattar came out unscathed while the ones on the losing side are those    mlas   none of them has been given the ticket for the upcoming assembly election.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowif dicey intra party dynamics weren t enough of a burden that made khattar seem like a weak link  external factors only added to his sorry image. the february      protests by jats over demand for reservation under the other backward class  obc  category brought haryana to a standstill. the army was called in and khattar came out looking like a powerless  inept and unprepared leader  bringing much embarrassment to the bjp that takes pride in its  strong leadership .already seen as someone with zero governance experience and barely there administrative capabilities  a series of such events added to khattar s woes.in august       dera sacha sauda chief gurmeet ram rahim singh s conviction led to violent agitations by his followers  leading to deaths and severe injuries. once again  the government was caught napping while the situation dangerously spiralled out of control. khattar  in fact  later did admit there had been  lapses . yet again  the  good governance  touting bjp was left red faced.a similar drama played out when supporters of rampal  a self styled godman  refused to allow the police to enter his ashram to arrest him. it was only after a long and embarrassing standoff lasting a week that the police were finally able to enter the ashram  but not before more damage had been done to khattar and his government s image.women s safety   or the lack thereof   and innumerable instances of rape  stalking and irresponsible statements by the administration became defining aspects of khattar s tenure. the infamous case involving the son of state bjp chief subhash barala in an alleged stalking incident brought terrible press to the party and an already beleaguered regime.for the first few years of his tenure  khattar seemed like a lost cause and haryana like a state the bjp would be unable to hold on to.also read  hit by rebellion and factionalism  congress sees maharashtra   haryana as lost battlesthe turnaroundnarendra modi and amit shah are hardly the sorts who sit back when a disaster is unfolding in their party   a marked difference from the helplessness and lack of interest of the congress high command.aware of the importance of retaining haryana and not wanting to lose a single election  the bjp top leadership is believed to have politely told khattar to get his act together. on his part  the initial rawness of leading a state gave way to a semblance of control and understanding. soon  things began to look up.with the congress being a non factor due to its own internal troubles and the chautalas  indian national lok dal  inld  splitting in late       khattar developed the much needed confidence that he could leave his problematic run behind and emerge as a powerful political force.controversies became few and far between  and khattar began talking more about development  good governance and the need to follow the  gujarat model  designed by modi himself. the proof of the bjp s changed electoral prospects in haryana came in december       when the party swept the mayoral polls.of course  khattar continues to make controversial comments  but they are more stray than being a regular feature. what his story  however  tells you is that even being absolutely down in the dumps can be reversed if  one  the party top command knows exactly when and how to step in  and two  leaders  even those who are seen as feeble and unskilled  are able to reorient themselves.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis   only you can fix it you are reading this because you value good  intelligent and objective

pitch for the nightlife in mumbai. aaditya supported former model dino morea s open gyms at marine lines and wadala. he strongly protested the felling of trees in the aarey forest for the metro car shed. in the past  the shiv sena launched agitations against south indians  gujaratis  biharis  up  bhaiyas  and muslims during the bhiwandi  aurangabad and mumbai riots. aaditya is trying to change the narrative of the shiv sena.at the worli meeting  aaditya thackeray said   this is the right time to work towards eliminating discrimination based on caste  language and religion . aaditya is aspiring to create a new maharashtra that is secure  literate  unemployment free  pollution free and debt free. at that rally  he did not utter a single word about ram mandir  kashmir s article      pakistan or muslims. this certainly is a welcome change in the shiv sena s leadership. recently  he undertook a jan ashirwad yatra across maharashtra. he made an effort to understand the problems of rural as well as urban maharashtra. aaditya s current worli constituency has slums  chawls and marathi  gujarati  punjabi and marwadi voters.his posters in worli are not in the typical shiv sena style. the text reads  how are you worli   in more than five languages including gujarati  urdu and hindi. his campaign is designed by poll strategist prashant kishore. shiv sena s style is aggressive and many times  abusive too. aaditya has chosen a different path altogether. he has chosen worli with an aim to reach out to a variety of people. he wants to change the  only for marathi manoos  line of his party.also read  when shiv sena s aditya thackeray told gurmehar kaur he is a feminista younger lookaaditya thackeray has studied in bombay scottish school and attended st xavier college and k.c. law college. he speaks fluent english. he also writes poems in english. his image is of a soft spoken  modest and a modern multilingual leader. he moves around in the upper middle and elite circle of maharashtra.traditionally  shiv sainiks were not well educated or sophisticated. they just obey the orders of the shiv sena paksha pramukh. they don t think much and believe in  direct action . but things are changing. young shiv sainiks and sympathisers of the party are much more qualified now. maharashtra is urbanizing rapidly. that is why aaditya is constantly saying that he aims for  new maharashtra .the bjp leadership is in the hands of young leaders like cm devendra fadnavis. the ncp is projecting leaders like young actor amol kolhe and sharad pawar s grandnephew rohit pawar. but the congress leadership is old  outdated and has failed to reinvent itself. if the face of a regressive and  gunda  party like the shiv sena is changing  it is good news.the author is a

we can t talk about gandhi if we don t speak up on kashmir and lynchings
text size  a  a writing a few years before gandhi s    th anniversary  ram manohar lohia  arguably the most astute interpreter of his politics  classified gandhians into three categories. the first was sarkari  governmental  gandhians  the congress leaders who used the mahatma to climb the ladder of power. mathadhish  priestly  those who run maths  gandhians  those who presided over the gandhian establishment  belonged to the second category. lohia made little attempt to conceal his contempt for both  represented in his mind by jawaharlal nehru and vinoba bhave.against both these orthodoxies  lohia posited a third type of kujaat  heretic  out caste  gandhians who followed gandhi in unorthodox ways. lohia argued that gandhi s orthodox disciples were not his true legatees. gandhi  he argued  would be saved not by his faithful followers but by heretics. lohia  of course  placed himself in this third category. deeply respectful but instinctively irreverent  he developed some of the key ideas of gandhi in his own way without parroting mahatma s lines.also read  why gandhi and ambedkar never engaged with hedgewar  the founder of rssneed to rescue gandhitoday  in the midst of the official    th anniversary celebrations  we must look for ways to rescue gandhi from this crass appropriation by an ideology diametrically opposed to the mahatma s worldview. lohia had alerted us about this possibility in his book marx  gandhi and socialism   ever since the attainment of statehood  by india   priestly gandhism is tied to the apron strings of governmental gandhism .he was of course talking about the nexus between goody goody spiritual gandhians and power brokers of the congress party. as gandhi was reduced   literally   to a toothless icon of timeless values  ever smiling on the currency note  the real gandhi was erased from public memory. barring a brief period before and during the emergency  the gandhian establishment was so cosy with the powers that be that it lost its radical edge and the touch with the new generation.this set the stage for the ultimate appropriation of the mahatma by the legatees of his assassin. the sabarmati ashram closing its doors to the victims of the      massacre signalled this shift. as the bjp rose to power  first in gujarat and then at the centre  it was not difficult for it to take over gandhian institutions. barring exceptions like the gandhi peace foundation and the sarva seva sangh  the vast network of gandhian institutions either withered away or turned collaborators.gandhi  now reduced to his spectacles and bald head  is just a mask available for any and every cause. he can be used to promote vegetarianism of the most violent variety. he is the patron saint of the most inane and harmless environmentalism. and  of course  the brand ambassador of swachh bharat.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it.

reconsider their rejection of mahatma gandhiunlearning gandhiif the gandhi centenary was about learning from his life  the    th anniversary has to be about unlearning his stereotypical image. polar opposite ideologies of the   th century   from marxists and ambedkarites to the hindutva brigade   joined hands to create this stereotype. both his admirers and detractors created the image of a goody goody saint   a traditional  orthodox and conservative hindu saint   out of touch with the realities of our times and the struggles for shaping the future.the best way to mark his    th anniversary would be to start busting this image. gandhi was no doubt a pacifist  but not at the cost of suffering injustice. he said repeatedly that violence is better than cowardice or meek acceptance of oppression. the uniqueness of his message lies not in his advocacy of non violence  but in using non violence as a tool of proactive resistance.he was a strict vegetarian  but insisted that meat be prepared in his ashram for khan abdul ghaffar khan. he advocated protecting nature  but his environmentalism did not rest on superficial symbols. he wanted to challenge the nature of modern civilisation  which is at the root of environmental destruction. he supported a return to pre modern civilisation  but he was not a traditional man in any sense of the term. his sensibilities  his techniques  his message were informed by a distinctly modern outlook.gandhi was a hindu to his last breath. but he was as far from orthodox hinduism as one can get. he refused to be shackled by any one religious text  not even his favourite  the gita. he could brush aside heaps of solid scriptural evidence in support of untouchability by saying  this is not the hinduism that my mother taught me . his hinduism was ever evolving.from someone who began by defending the varna system  gandhi went on to become such a trenchant critic of the caste system that he refused to go to any wedding except between a dalit and a non dalit. equally  while being opposed to hindu supremacists  gandhi was no knee jerk  pro minority secular politician. he staked and lost one of his most precious friendships  with ali brothers  over naming the muslim community as aggressors in kohat riots in     . for all his love for the bible  he came down heavily on the practice of religious conversions by missionaries.also read  gandhi never celebrated his birthdays  but made an exception on his   th. for kasturbawho is a gandhi perhaps  the best way to recover gandhi s message in the midst of this celebratory din would be to read his life as his message. over the last decades  those who haven taken gandhi seriously have reduced him to a writer  or a philosopher  which he was not. his writings were secondary to his principal political actions. he may not have been the best interpreter of his own action.let us search for gandhi in his life and in the lives of those who may not invoke gandhi  who may not agree with gandhi  but who are doing what gandhi would have done. let us look for him in shankar guha niyogi who combined gandhi s teachings with that of marx. let us find his meaning in the works of devanoora mahadeva who refuses to choose between ambedkar and gandhi. let us turn to ashis nandy to understand the meaning of gandhi s life and his death let us look for gandhis beyond india  beyond the circle of those who have heard his name.and  above all  let us translate gandhi s message in our lives here and now. we cannot talk about gandhi and remain a mute spectator to the imprisoning of millions of kashmiris in the valley. we cannot preach non violence and turn a blind eye to the spate of lynchings and other hate crimes. we cannot join the national chorus to celebrate this apostle of truth and not call out those on the national stage who are masters of lies and deceit.this is not going to be easy. chanting gandhi s name is easy  but following in his footsteps was

indian liberals must reconsider their rejection of mahatma gandhi
text size  a  a was gandhi gay  was he racist  did he assault his nieces  wasn t his food faddism a bit too comical  was he the enemy of dalits  with questions like these  over the decades  gandhi has been assailed and brought down by the holier than thou radicals of the world. in doing so  they have helped the world forget the central reason why gandhi mattered  his political techniques of resistance.you don t have to agree with gandhi on anything at all  and you could still be inspired by satyagraha  by non violent resistance and civil disobedience. some years ago  when anna hazare sat on a fast  there were people who were irritated by his use of gandhian means of politics. what a fraud  they said  he is not gandhian  he s an rss agent. yet  even narendra modi once sat on a gandhi style  sadbhavna  fast.in fact  all that ambedkar had to do to counter gandhi during the poona pact  osho wrote  was to sit on an indefinite fast himself.the point is that gandhian means don t have to match gandhian ends.research by erica chenoweth  a political scientist at harvard university  has shown that the most successful rebellions are the ones that use non violent civil disobedience. the only condition is that a large number of people    .  per cent of the population  according to her research   have to be involved in the movement. it is for this reason why anybody engaged in politics  left or right  must study gandhi s means of doing politics. by picking up a fistful of salt he challenged the british empire. that is the sort of thing that makes gandhi timeless and relevant regardless of his political ideology.also read  this is why mahatma gandhi forgave general dyer even after jallianwala bagh massacrepick and choosegandhi is so vast that you can take from him what you like. he wrote so much  he was documented so widely  he has been debated endlessly  that you can make whatever you want of gandhi. and yet the left liberal intelligentsia  the self serving congress party  the lohiaite socialists  the radical ambedkarites  and the brooding communists have all conspired to bury gandhi.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowthe burial of gandhi has helped in the rise of hindutva. yet  the only people to whom mahatma gandhi matters is the hindutva right. they cannot reject him as easily as they have discarded nehru. modi s answer is to reduce gandhi to sanitation. sooner or later  they will find a way to appropriate gandhi as a good hindu as opposed to the bad nehru.as for the congress party  the wider opposition  the left liberal intelligentsia   gandhi is dead. he does not matter  worse  he does not show them the way anymore. gandhi is seen by them at best as a relic of history not relevant to post independent india  and at worst as a casteist  racist  misogynist old man best not spoken about.if the opposition were to take gandhi seriously  they could learn a lot from him. they would learn political communication and campaigning from him. they would know the way out of intractable issues  such as communal politics. they could perhaps even learn how to assert morality in the face of injustice. the man who took on indira gandhi  jayaprakash narayan  was inspired by gandhian thought.also read  mahatma gandhi is arriving shortlyevent management gandhi stylehad the opposition learnt from gandhi  they would have known that it is futile to do anything for a day. priyanka gandhi vadra  who visits uttar pradesh like a tourist  will again be marching in lucknow for a few hours wednesday.when gandhi was undertaking his salt march  the very idea was to bring about greater public awareness and participation  making it a campaign that touched people. he could simply have gone to dandi and picked up salt. the march was undertaken after a lot of preparation  with his followers going from village to village and telling people that the mahatma would stop overnight there  and what he would like them to do.narendra modi also goes about doing politics through planned events. his critics rubbish it as event management. yet  these events capture people s minds and result in     seats. if these critics were alive in gandhi s time  they would have criticised him for event management. the problem is that the opposition do not know event management  nor do they care.it may be difficult to defend gandhi s views on economics in the modern world  though a world where consumption economies are bringing about climate change  one may want to look at them anyway . ambedkar won over gandhi on caste. prohibition  which gandhi backed  is certainly against individual freedom  although we cannot pretend alcoholism is not a widespread social problem. but we don t have to follow every word gandhi said. his power lay in the means  the

why gandhi and ambedkar never engaged with hedgewar  the founder of rss
text size  a  a the careers of m.k. gandhi  b.r. ambedkar and k.b. hedgewar took off in the same decades  but they had very few attributes in common. they shared almost two decades of public life and started their journey in the undivided state of bombay. but surprisingly  gandhi and ambedkar almost ignored the presence of hedgewar and the organisation he founded  the rss.gandhi took the helm of affairs of congress in        the year congress started the non cooperation movement  side lining an array of towering leaders including b.g. tilak  m.m. malviya  c.r. das and others. three years prior  in       ambedkar got his first thesis titled  castes in india  published. by       ambedkar had emerged as the sole voice of the oppressed classes  and in       he attended the second roundtable conference in that capacity.hedgewar  then a congress worker from nagpur  left the freedom movement and founded the rss in     . so  there were at least    years of overlapping in the public life of these personalities  before hedgewar died in     . gandhi and ambedkar did not engage with the rss even when golwalkar became the rss chief.also read  mahatma gandhi is arriving shortlyit can t be attributed to just disagreements.despite disagreeing on many issues  gandhi and ambedkar continuously engaged with each other through various platforms. gandhi and ambedkar had different takes on the social reform movement and it was their main bone of contention. still  they kept meeting and wrote long letters to each other  mostly to register their disagreement. ambedkar argued that social reforms should precede political freedom whereas gandhi s argument was that india should first attain freedom and social issues can be resolved later on.there was only one instance of gandhi meeting hedgewar  in       and gandhi rejected the idea of rss summarily. similarly  ambedkar only once met a delegation of hedgewar  golwalkar and savarkar  but rejected the idea of a hindu rashtra. the level of their disengagement was such that it s hard to find even the name of hedgewar in the    volumes of the writings and speeches of ambedkar.we are deeply grateful to our readers

gandhi made ambedkar a villain in his fight to be the real representative of dalitsbjp s plan to co opt gandhi   ambedkarnow  the bjp rss is trying to co opt gandhi and trying to pitch him against the congress  but the same gandhi never gave any importance to the rss in his lifetime. he was an antithesis to whatever the rss stood for on all public issues including nation building  democracy  social reforms and secularism.today  after    years of all things gandhi propagated  rss bjp only found cleanliness or swachhata as a legacy to co opt. as if gandhi had done nothing other than sweeping his ashram floors and cleaning his toilet in his entire life.it seems that gandhi and ambedkar had a common itinerary  as far as nation building is concerned  although they had different priorities. whereas hedgewar was charting an altogether different course of action   that of making bharat into a hindu rashtra.before gandhi returned to india  the congress was a party of social and economic elites. gandhi changed all that and had broad based the freedom movement by inducting muslims  farmers and dalits in the congress. the armchair politics of the congress had to pave way for a mass movement involving lakhs of common men and women. a bania gandhi leading the freedom movement was not the idea of india envisaged by the likes of chiplunkar  tilak and their disciple hedgewar. soon after the demise of tilak  hedgewar left the congress led freedom struggle and started to organise the hindus to regain the so called past glory of aryavarta.explaining this phenomenon  ambedkar  in his treatise  gandhi  ranade and jinnah  argued   the intelligentsia was divided into two schools a school which was orthodox in its belief but unpolitical in its outlook  and a school which was modern in its beliefs but primarily political in its aims and objects. the former was led by mr chiplunkar and the latter by mr tilak. both combined against ranade and created as many difficulties for him as they could. tilak stood against all social reforms including empowerment of women  inter caste marriages  increase in the age of consent  inclusion of farming communities and the underclass in public life  and so on and so forth. he imagined the past as glorious and even declared that if the british had not come to india  the peshwas would be ruling the entire country. the rss had a similar dream of making india great again. gandhi and ambedkar were of no use in this project as both were modernists as far as their political thoughts were concerned.but democratic politics has its own exigencies and for the sake of it  the bjp rss is now trying to co opt both gandhi and ambedkar in its scheme of things.also read  you can be a hindu nationalist and an ambedkarite botha difficult taskfor the bjp rss  ambedkar is a difficult pill to swallow because he had an explicitly antithetical stance on the hindu rashtra. he unequivocally declared that   if hindu raj does become a fact  it will  no doubt  be the greatest calamity for this country. no matter what the hindus say  hinduism is a menace to liberty  equality and fraternity. on that account it is incompatible with democracy. hindu raj must be prevented at any cost. on the other hand  it is easier for the rss to appropriate gandhi  who had a lenient view on the varna system based hindu society and looked back in history

mahatma gandhi is arriving shortly
text size  a  a when the scorching heat of the indian summer gets beyond unbearable  the monsoon rains arrive. no matter how little or how abundant the rains are  they carry with them the promise of life.like the summer heat  people suffer growing oppression as a test of their patience. eventually  a hero emerges  overthrowing the oppressors.if that sounds too filmy a tale  how do you explain the rumours in champaran in         about a  chamatkaari baba   a saint with miraculous powers  who would soon arrive in champaran the farmers of champaran were undergoing great suffering under the british. they tried to do something about it. they filed cases  they tried civil disobedience on their own  only to get beaten up.what they needed was a hero  and rumours started spreading that a hero was about to arrive in champaran  a messiah from the heavens. they knew the messiah s name  gandhi  who had demonstrated his magical powers for indians in south africa. he knew how to get his way with the englishmen  and some in champaran were convinced that he was going to arrive in this remote bihar district   one had to take an elephant ride from patna to reach champaran.mind you  gandhi had not even heard of champaran in        . he was travelling across india  attending congress sessions  speaking against princes and congress leaders and the british alike. a farmer from champaran went to gandhi in       followed him around from one city to another  and dragged him to champaran on an elephant. gandhi spent more than six months in champaran  leaving only after he had freed the farmers from the oppression of the british indigo planters.also read  can india have a liberal mass hero ever again we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowcometh the hour  cometh the mantoday  india is witnessing oppression and injustice in all corners. the hindutva forces that did little to overthrow the british are now in power. they want to disenfranchise millions of muslims and put them in detention centres. they have already turned the kashmir valley into one large detention centre. they are bringing economic ruin to the people  causing job losses and decline in incomes. they enable lynch mobs  protect rapists  put opposition leaders in jail  disallow protests  muzzle truth and dissent with police cases  turn heroes into villains and villains into heroes. we have a government that openly wants to make india a one party system with one religion and one language.there are rumours  once again  that a chamatkaari baba will arrive and put an end to this oppression of majoritarianism. we do not yet know the name of the hero  or when s he will come. the heavens will send one  that much is certain. there s no better time than the    th birth anniversary of mahatma gandhi to believe in heroes  and to hope. the greater the repression  the bigger the mahatma that will be born. every action has an equal and opposite reaction  as someone famously said.newspapers across the world wrote in awe of what a figure mahatma gandhi had become in india. an american paper in      insisted he was inspired by jesus   somebody gave him the bible in london. he picked up the old testament  read through genesis and the rest put him to sleep. he picked up the new testament and was wide awake. jesus enthralled him. the sermon on the mount went straight to his heart. also read  what priyanka gandhi vadra could learn from mahatma gandhi if you do as i tell you it doesn t matter if gandhi was inspired by jesus or buddha  what s more important is that he was being compared to them in his lifetime. there s a quality about heroes  real or mythical  that is immediately recognisable. heroes believe  above all  in their own ability to bring change. in       urging farmers in gorakhpur to shun violence and follow his path of non violent civil disobedience  mahatma gandhi said   i want to tell you  if you follow my programme   i want to assure  you  if you do as i tell you  we shall get swaraj by the end of september. the   st century mahatma may not come from any of the current political parties. s he might  who knows  alight from a ship from south africa via london the task ahead is so onerous that the   st century mahatma will not look forward to european vacations. instead  s he will look forward to going to jail. that s how gandhi chose sabarmati as the site of his ashram in ahmedabad   its vicinity to the sabarmati central jail was for me a special attraction. as jail going was understood to be the normal lot of satyagrahis  i liked this position .our modern mahatma will probably read what mahatma gandhi had to say about his times and realise the more things change  the more they remain the same. gandhi wrote about his first impression of the indian national congress in        the congress would meet three days every year and then go to sleep . if that sounds a lot like the opposition today  we know what it needs is a mahatma.modern day mahatma will not come and blame an unfriendly media. mahatmas create their own vehicles to reach out to the masses. gandhi edited and published his own newspapers. he wrote in his memoirs about the newspaper he ran in south africa   the tone of indian opinion compelled the critic to put a curb on his own pen. satyagraha would probably have been impossible without indian opinion. our modern day mahatma will not be an anglophone  but speak the language of the masses. gandhi repeatedly chided the congress party for speaking in english. his criticism of the congress party in the early   th century would be apt for today s opposition as well. he wrote about the congress session he attended in        the volunteers were clashing against one another. you asked one of them to do something. he delegated it to another  and he in his turn to a third and so on  and as for the delegates  they were neither here nor there. it will take a mahatma to put the opposition s house in order. such a saviour will not take it for granted that the opposition has lost its mass connect. s he will go around creating cadres and seeking volunteers. gandhi wrote in        really i am recruiting mad. i do nothing else  think of nothing else  talk of nothing else  save one on recruiting .also read  what unfolded when gandhi met a playwright  a fascist  a comic legend  a nobel laureatenot all heroes wear loin clothgandhi wore the loin cloth because he wanted to be the same as the poorest of the poor. he wanted to be one with them. our modern day mahatma may not wear a loin cloth. perhaps  she might wear a saree. what s he will definitely have in common with gandhi is the commitment to the masses. s he will think about the people  and not his or her own comforts.for all his criticism of the congress  he ended up joining it and even presiding over it for a year. he noted as early as in        public work in those days meant congress work . gandhi thought that after independence  the congress party should do  public work . for this purpose  he felt the party should transform into a  lok sewak sangh   an organisation in the service of the people. the voice of the people is the voice of god   gandhi wrote. after his first meeting with the farmers in champaran  he wrote   it is no exaggeration  but the literal truth  to say that in this meeting with the peasants i was face to face with god  ahimsa and truth .when we see a politician who understands this  we will be able to say that a mahatma has arrived.also read  when mahatma gandhi washed kasturba s soiled petticoatviews are

milind deora isn t alone. in post rahul congress  gen next stars struggling as politicians
text size  a  a when former south mumbai mp milind deora praised prime minister narendra modi s speech at the  howdy  modi   event in houston calling it a  momentous first for india s soft power diplomacy  and was met with a gracious reply from narendra modi  recalling both his father  whom he called a  friend  as well as his commitment to strong indo us ties  he was in a way echoing murli deora s best principles. the late murli deora believed in friends across the political  social and corporate spectrum. he also was a great proponent of strong ties with the us  despite being close to indira gandhi who spent much of her time as prime minister being the object of american disaffection.but india has changed  and so has its politics. there is no room for a gentleman industrialist politician who can bridge political and corporate rivalries  who can wear savile row suits and still be popular among the poorest in his swish south mumbai constituency  who can play bridge and kingmaker with equal  lan  and who can host global moghuls in his posh peddar road home and then separate them from their money for philanthropic causes in the slums.so  when milind deora  educated at cathedral and john connon school  sydenham college  and boston university speaks like us president lyndon johnson   i am a free man  an american  a united states senator  and a democrat  in that order    he invariably comes up against a wall of disbelief  especially in maharashtra s toxic congress politics  which has already seen the departure of significant leaders. in a political culture where actions are valued more than words  and the ability to mobilise crowds matters more than the power to organise an invite to the weekend with charlie rose for rahul gandhi your fellow dynast leader  milind deora may well be a misfit.milind deora s crossroads is not his alone. if young politicians like him  like jyotiraditya scindia and sachin pilot  are unable to rise in their parties  unable to connect with india s burgeoning youth or dislodge the image of the congress as a party of the old and outdated  then something is broken in politics in deeper ways than is visible to outsiders.it goes beyond just the modi sway  rahul gandhi s ineptitude and the fall from grace of dynastic politics. these young politicians are falling into the gaps between the plates that sprung from the      elections. it s a debilitating crisis of imagination.also read  rahul gandhi criticises howdy  modi  but his party peers can t stop praising ita post rahul congressmilind deora s precarious position today in a post rahul congress has tragic overtones. he is a leader who hasn t been tested fully yet and he s already in a quandary. just like rahul gandhi.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe noweven though he criticised him and his advisers after the      election results  deora was in rahul gandhi s close circle and a trusted friend. he took him to the us  lined up tech startup ceos for him. now  deora looks more wingless than ever.having lost twice in succession in      and      from his father s constituency  which sent him to the lok sabha in                  and        despite support from the country s richest man  mukesh ambani  milind deora is missing in action as congress fights a clearly losing battle in maharashtra against a pumped up bjp. even before the battle could begin  milind has quit as chief of the mumbai congress  a position his father  former mayor of the city  occupied for    years.naamdar vs kaamdarby his own admission     year old milind deora is a child of privilege  which naturally comes from being born to an industrialist father who would play bridge with adi godrej and deepak parekh and be close enough to dhirubhai ambani for his children mukesh and anil to call him  uncle . as he wrote in simply mumbai  india today  in        growing up was all about going to chowpatty  playing tennis at nslta  squash and badminton at bombay gym  watching movies at sterling and shopping at fashion street.  but then  he added  south mumbai to him is more than just haji ali and nariman point.  for  further east are mumbadevi  khetwadi  umarkhadi  bhuleshwar  where my father comes from  places that have a life and colour of their own. the fact that irealise this  makes me different from the quintessential south mumbaiite. unfortunately  in the past two attempts  he has been unable to convince the voter that he is more than his famous last name  caught as he is in a new culture that pits the  naamdars  against the  kaamdars   the dynasts vs the meritocrats.also read  discontent  dissent   defiance in congress as gandhi family begins to lose grip on partystuck between losing congress   crowded bjppolitical analyst radhika ramaseshan is unimpressed by the former minister of state for telecommunications and it. she says   milind deora never struck me as a serious  far sighted politician. like many of his peers  he s a legatee  the beneficiary of an inheritance that saw his parent  murli deora  through in more comfortable times for the congress. he has several interests  music for one  that s fair enough. but in the days of   x  politics  calling for single minded devotion to its pursuit  i wonder if a career politician can have time for other passions. she also feels that he s clearly unencumbered by ideologies because he didn t think twice about endorsing the modi government doing away with article    .  had he read up the congress s history and the extensive debates preceding the introduction of      maybe he would have got a different perspective. it s a choice that milind and his peers will have to eventually make  whether to flow with the current stream or adhere to the congress s core beliefs   she pointed out.indeed  the congress has diluted its basic values  moving from secularism to soft hindutva  and from being the party of the freedom struggle to allowing the bjp to claim the nationalist agenda. with a leadership mostly marked by its embarrassing waffling or its uninterested absence  the so called generation next  now in their forties  are left without a compass.newsx anchor priya sahgal who has written about him in her book the contenders  who will lead india tomorrow   simon and schuster   said milind deora embodies the existential crisis of many younger leaders within the congress. he is definitely at odds with the old guard s outdated politics. but  as she noted  going to the bjp is not an option either. she added   himanta biswa sarma told me recently when he joined the bjp there was a vacuum in the northeast. there is no vacuum in the north or west that would accommodate a deora or a scindia or a pilot. they would not enjoy the hallowed space they do or did in rahul gandhi s congress. so  they are really stuck between a party that is losing its relevance and a party where they would have no relevance. also read  in politics  age is just a number. even if it is  young  rahul gandhi sshe was not too surprised with milind s recent comments or what is being seen an outreach to the bjp  whether it is his stand on article     or modi s us trips.  he may be the last standing nice guy in politics  one who weighs his conscience and beliefs instead of blindly following party handouts. i recall an interview milind gave me right before the      uttar pradesh assembly elections  he was the first to say the congress needed a credible narrative of its own instead of merely criticising the modi government. as he said   simply expecting people to vote for a party because they are disillusioned with the incumbent is not enough.  this is a line that was later picked up by others within the congress. unfortunately for them  such is the stranglehold of one family over the party  that they are never included in the names that come up as credible alternatives.but nothing can be ruled out in politics  so it is no surprise that kripashankar singh  who quit the congress recently  speaks approvingly of milind deora.  his experience in various fields can be a good contribution to the nation  party and people. he s the kind of leader the youth are looking for

realistic  virile minded visionary with a will of iron to carry it out .chaplin even witnessed the evening prayer of gandhi and five others in the room.  what a paradox  i thought  as i watched this

modi shah s bjp thinks it doesn t need mass leaders in states. so did indira gandhi s congress
text size  a  a there is a new congress in town and it s the bharatiya janata party. this was the title of a column i had written in theprint in october last year. i had spotted five trends  or indicators  in the bjp to arrive at that conclusion  the high command ist culture  a premium on loyalty and sycophancy  promotion of leaders with no mass base  nepotism  and pervasive cliques around power centres.since then  a new trend has emerged in the bjp  something that started in the congress under former prime minister indira gandhi and was perpetuated by her successors  a systematic undermining and demolition of mass leaders in states. this was the genesis of the congress party s eventual fall.the bjp is repeating that mistake by virtually sidelining most of its prominent state leaders  karnataka chief minister b.s. yediyurappa  former chief ministers vasundhara raje  rajasthan   shivraj singh chouhan  madhya pradesh  and raman singh  chhattisgarh . one could add many more

cautioning the bjp against deposing him.raje  chouhan and singh  all former chief ministers of the states that the bjp lost last year  have no one to speak for them in the party. the three are proven

the bjp attributed it to the  modi wave   the party s prime ministerial candidate then. cut to december     . the same people were castigating them for the party s defeat in the assembly elections. the high command was quick to appoint them as national vice presidents of the bjp  a ceremonial post. it was meant to be a signal of the end of their role in state politics  and not a mark of acknowledgement to their contributions. raje and raman singh don t have a room of their own at the bjp headquarters in new delhi. they sit in whichever room is unoccupied. chouhan was made in charge

and protracted turf war with regional satraps to establish her supremacy in the party  indira gandhi turned averse to promoting anyone in the states who was a leader in his or her own right. all congress chief ministers had to owe their chairs to only her and not to the people. being a mass leader was soon to become a big minus point in the congress.the bjp never had a syndicate as such. when

least until the next lok sabha election.there may be some bjp leaders who acquire the image of being strong and decisive as modi has been or as vallabhbhai patel was. they may have strong oratorical skills  too. but he or she wouldn t have the same hypnotic influence on the masses. a narendra modi is born after generations.whenever modi decides to hang his boots  the bjp will need strong regional leaders to keep the saffron flag flying high. the ones being propped up and promoted in states today hardly inspire any confidence. and that should keep raje and her ilk hopeful.subscribe to our

as mahatma gandhi turns      his news magazines navjivan and young india turn    
text size  a  a mohandas karamchand gandhi s    th birth anniversary coincides with another milestone  the centenary of his two magazines young india and navjivan            . both periodicals  under the editorship of gandhi  covered issues like the first non cooperation movement in       the           khilafat movement  gandhi s imprisonment under sedition charges in        highs and lows of hindu muslim relations  debates on untouchability  dandi march in       the second round table conference in      and his visit to europe in     .with prior experience of owning a press and running a weekly paper the indian opinion in south africa  gandhi knew the nitty gritty of journalism and the importance of owning a mouthpiece to convey his unique thoughts.also read  if you opened the newspapers from    august       here are the freedom ads you would seegandhi the prolific editorthe first opportunity for gandhi to run magazines in india arrived in      when umar sobani and shankarlal banker  two young supporters of home rule league that fought for bringing self rule in india  offered him the editorship of their weekly young india. incidentally  the home rule league of america was also bringing out a monthly with the same name  which had no connection with the indian young india.this was playing out during the peak of the anti rowlatt act movement in     . the british government in pre independent india suppressed the daily the bombay chronicle  which had a nationalist perspective and deported its pro movement british editor b. g. horniman. sobani and banker  helming the agency s managerial affairs  asked gandhi to take over the responsibility of the bombay chronicle. but  when the paper had to shut down its operations due to government pressure  the duo suggested gandhi take over their english weekly young india to carry on the spirit of the freedom struggle. gandhi too was  anxious to expound the inner meaning of satyagraha to the public  and also desperate to help the cause of the  punjab situation   which worsened after the martial law excesses.  an autobiography or the story of my experiments with truth  m.k. gandhi  translated by mahadev desai  navjivan press  may       page     in the meantime  indulal yajnik  a passionate young leader and associate of sobani and banker offered editorship of his gujarati monthly navjivan ane satya to gandhi. he accepted it readily and dropped satya  truth  from the name  most probably because it was indicative of a merger of two different magazines navjivan and satya.the first issue of navjivan with gandhi as the editor came out on   september     . explaining  our aim   gandhi noted that  if anyone asks why  if i wished to serve india  i should not pour out my soul through english  i would say in reply that  being a gujarati by birth and way of life  i can serve india best only by identifying myself completely with the life of gujarat .we are deeply grateful to our readers

preference for conversing and writing in india s regional languages  he wrote in the same article   navjivan will take every possible occasion to show that it is in vain that we are so infatuated with

navjivan  page  . english translation  collected works of mahatma gandhi  volume     page    young india under gandhi was a bi weekly publication  but the additional responsibility of supervising the weekly navjivan forced gandhi to turn young india into a weekly newspaper. gandhi ran both the magazines from ahmedabad  at times publishing an extra midweek edition or additional pages to its routine   page issue. the period from      to      saw a steep rise in the circulation of his two weeklies along with a surge in the indian freedom movement.gandhi once noted   both of them reached a very wide circulation which at one time rose to the neighbourhood of forty thousand each . he also observed a pattern   while the circulation of navjivan went up faster  young india increased only by slow degrees .also read  ambedkar was wrong  gandhi wrote against untouchability in gujarati journals tooreaching massesgandhi s prison term after the famous sedition case in       for writing two

 translated by mahadev desai  navjivan press  may       page      despite this setback  gandhi termed navjivan as  weekly report of the progress of swaraj .his widely known autobiography an autobiography  the story of my experiments with truth was first serialised in navjivan as a history of the satyagraha movement in south africa. both the magazines  printed on full scape size paper  had eight pages of content without any advertisement  presented in a double column layout. the year ender issue would give a complete subject and article index of the numerous issues covered throughout the year. gandhi would be very punctual about meeting deadlines and would send his contributions by post even when he was travelling.these magazines became live platforms for gandhi to interact with the masses. he would agree to print nasty letters  but replied to them with patience  coherently putting across his viewpoint. he was ably aided by his multi talented secretary mahadev desai who was proficient in both gujarati and english. gandhi s other associates like activists and writers swami anand  kaka kalelkar  narhari parikh contributed to navjivan and shaped gujarati language and translations of that era. they also ran the paper when gandhi was imprisoned in the sedition case. one can read a few articles and appeals of vallabhbhai patel in navjivan  especially during gandhi s imprisonment.also read  gandhi wasn t the only freedom leader to miss nehru s      i day speech. there were others toothe death of the two magazinesboth young india and navjivan had to be closed down due to gandhi s arrest and the crackdown on the satyagraha movement in     . young india continued to come out in cyclostyled version of   pages and even regained its regular form

ahead of maharashtra polls  congress has given up  but sharad pawar s ncp still fighting
text size  a  a four months after the      lok sabha elections  the congress led opposition is still struggling to recover from its dreadful performance. the congress should have been introspective and analysed the reason for its terrible defeat  but it still looks clueless.the congress does not have a strong leader who can be the face of the party. its leaders look hopeless in maharashtra as well. it doesn t have a solid organisation and is outdated. it seems that the congress does not have any motivation and is at a standstill in the state.with assembly elections due in maharashtra  haryana and jharkhand  the bjp has started campaigning in full force  whereas the opposition still does not know what has to be done.the mainstream media seems sold on the idea of narendra modi and amit shah ruling india for a long time.there is no strong opposition left to question the modi government  but it still can be done if the congress gets its act together.also read  silent resentment in shiv sena as bjp won t settle for smaller share of seats anymoreahead of the assembly elections  the opposition can question the government on the economic slowdown  unemployment and rural distress. some opposition leaders have been questioning the government  but it has not garnered media attention. insteadmainstream media has been focusing on which leader is quitting the congress andthe ncp and joining either the bjp or the shiv sena. ahead of three state polls  prominent leaders like udayanraje bhosale and ganesh naik quitting the ncp to join the bjp is a setback for the ncp. for the congress  prominent leaders like radhakrishna vikhe patil and former mumbai congress chief kripashankar singh quitting the party is bad news.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for

primary issueslike economy  unemployment and farm crisis to secondary topicslike article      in the name of  desh ke liye kar rahe hai  doing it for the nation  .the main point is not which party is doing what for a better public image  butthat it s up to the voters who they elect. and guess what  the voters are getting influenced by the media strategies of the bjp and the so called modi wave.

here s how indian films of the     s and     s used gandhi in their ads
text size  a  a the advent of cinema and the rise of mohandas karamchand gandhi happened almost parallelly in india. however  gandhi would place cinema with other vices like  race course  drink booth and opium den  as the  enemies of the society .     march     . collected works of mahatma gandhi  vol.    page     .during a conversation with jayaprakash narayan and other socialists  gandhi said   if i had my way  i would see to it that all the cinemas and theatres in india were converted in to spinning halls and factories of handicrafts of all kind.      may     . cwmg vol.    page    but gandhi s disdain for cinema didn t prevent the fledgeling indian film industry from using his name and his values   directly or indirectly   for publicising movies. one way of doing this was to show a short documentary on gandhi in the middle of a film  as is evident in the following advertisement of the      film chintamani. its promotional write up read   talkie film of a speech mahatma gandhi gave at azad maidan  which has been exclusively produced by krishna company. also running is the film of his great reception from steamer pilsna to mani bhuvan. do come with family to have the privilege of mahatmaji s darshan and listen to his clear speech. also read  you don t know gandhi if you don t know about his   gujarati comradesone of the most bizarre film ads featuring mahatma gandhi was that of jungle king  released in     .quite apparent from its name and the accompanying visuals  it must have been a desi version of tarzan  made under the banner of action film production house wadia. yet  the ad claimed  the film is an unparalleled  topical  on gandhiji s activities in delhi  with gandhi s name featured prominently.much before david dhawan and govinda s  number one  films became a household name  there was the prakash pictures produced hero no.   in      that people know little about. prakash pictures  owned by gujarati brothers vijay and shankar bhatt  was a prominent film production company that made ram rajya in        the only hindi film gandhi watched  but did not like at all. the advertisement for hero no.   displayed gandhi s name at the top  underlining it. its tagline was   a unique crime thriller based on the same principle on which mahatma gandhiji secured victory at rajkot . the  thriller  ad also proclaimed that the film was about the  adventures of a ten year old boy   and  cheats eluding policemen .we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and

not one of the most glorious events of gandhi s public life. but this did not deter film publicists from using it to advertise their movies. an advertisement for  a terrific urdu talkie  in       namely payam e haq a.k.a. neetivijay reads   just like the saint became victorious in the battle of truth and untruth at rajkot  right and truth always win at the end in the battle of good and bad  dharma and adharma. many princely states were hostile towards gandhi s satyagraha movement and his ways. the advertisement of the      film royal commander targeted the princes and said   if the princes accept golden advice of mahatmaji  new history of princestan will be written with golden ink. but indulged in luxury  they can t find the true path.  the film claimed that it  portrays the exact reason for it .few publicists played smart by dragging mahatma gandhi s name in for film promotions even when their movies had nothing to do with him. an example of this is an advertisement for the movie maya machhindra        that screams   there s huge rush for darshan of that mahatma fighting against the ordinance . obviously  the original story of macchindranath can t have an ordinance in it. but the words  mahatma  and  ordinance  were enough to ring a bell in the minds of the readers in terms of what the advertisement was referring to.similarly  the      film  shiva janma   meaning birth of lord shiva  was presented as the  great inspirational story of a mahatma who gave immortal message of freedom to entire india     years back . the word  mahatma  has been highlighted in the headline so that readers don t miss the parallel between gandhi and lord shiva.also read  the two family members of mahatma gandhi who dared to disagree with himthe social climate in the country brought about by gandhi s movement against untouchability inspired many conventional formula films. one such film was achhut in     . made both in hindi and gujarati by the leading film production company of that time  ranjit movietone  the film in one of its advertisements highlighted three virtues that gandhi propagated till his last breath  ahimsa  non violence   satyagraha  truth  and swatantra  freedom .gandhi himself never said anything about these film advertisements  but if his views on cinema were anything to go by  it is safe to say that he would not have approved of them.the author is a senior columnist and writer based in ahmedabad. views are personal.this is the first edition of the four part series on mahatma gandhi ahead of his    th birth anniversary. read

what the congress party needs is a palace coup
text size  a  a one of the most important purposes of opinion writing is to hold those in power accountable through criticism of their policies and actions. although  as academician pratap bhanu mehta argues that  your credibility as a critic lies on the presumption of praise  when it is called for   it is usually superfluous to praise the government because it is usually in a good position to do that job itself. your puny whistle won t make a difference to the orchestra of trumpets that the government commands.opinion writers are often asked why they don t criticise the opposition as much as they criticise the government. while many columnists do indeed have ideological and partisan biases  it is not the most productive use of time to criticise parties and politicians who are not in power. what they say does not affect people s lives until they win elections  come to office  and are in a position to do something. of course  this does not prevent many of our brave television anchors who valiantly hold powerless opposition figures to account  while studiously ignoring those from the ruling party. they bask in the warm glory of kicking a person when he is down.also read  modi shah led bjp already preparing for       while congress still reels from     congress indictment is necessaryin normal circumstances it would have been pointless or craven to criticise the indian national congress when it is in the opposition. but at a time when the bjp enjoys unprecedented political dominance and massive popular support  when constitutional institutions and norms are crumbling  the national interest requires a credible opposition. while the government of narendra modi and amit shah has received severe criticism for its policies  the congress has largely been excused for its failure to effectively hold the end of opposition. too many people are too understanding and too forgiving of its internal problems and leadership woes. yet  to prevent a  congress mukt bharat   it is necessary to severely indict it for its failings and compel the grand old party to get its act together. and you don t have to be a supporter of the congress party to want an effective opposition in parliament.my indictment of the congress is threefold  most of its leaders do not know what they stand for  its organisation is hopelessly out of date  and   quite obviously   it lacks the quality of top leadership that the situation demands.there is space for congressjust as power abhors a vacuum  politics abhors a monopoly. human nature and democratic structure suggest that there is a space for credible counter point to the bjp. but few congress leaders seem to know what that space entails. given the absence of a motive  coherent party ideology  all that congress leaders seem to want to do is acquire power for the sake of its spoils. we saw the bewildering situation in karnataka last year when congress leaders were destabilising a fragile coalition government of which they were a part  in one of the only big states their party was in power  while facing a massive bjp juggernaut.why would people vote for the congress when its leaders are going to be more interested in ministerships than in governance  instead of fighting for the soul and structure of india  the congress sometimes projects itself as a pseudo bjp  at other times  it convinces itself that clever caste combinations and freebies will do the trick. despite being the party that gave us the economic reforms that created two decades of prosperity and pulled     million people out of poverty  many of its leaders and supporters criticise markets and capitalism.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowalso read  media bashing as a political strategy works for modi. the opposition could use it toothe ultimate stepwhile amit shah has exploited technology and built processes and transformed the bjp into a   st century political party  the congress remains in a previous era. its supporters will cite the reorganisation of the youth congress  better use of social media and data analytics  but also complain in the same breath that  the old guard is the problem . the congress does not have a functional party organisation anymore   it only has a last minute rush with money as the only means to mobilise opportunistic workers a few weeks before elections. a national election is as much a contest between organisational effectiveness as it is about ideologies  personalities and policies. to be able to challenge the bjp  the congress must recreate itself organisationally to match or counter it.finally  the leader the congress needs is not the one it will want. while some of its younger leaders have indeed turned into mass leaders in their own right  what the party needs is a palace coup. a leader who rises to power by overthrowing the old guard will capture public imagination just as a certain bjp leader did in     . the bjp has turned many parts of the congress legacy into a debilitating political liability. that s why the new congress leadership that comes to power in spite of the old congress will enjoy public credibility. it might then be able to sharpen what the congress stands for  rebuild the party organisation  and pose a real challenge to the bjp.also read  supine opposition helps modi ignore global human rights concerns on kashmir   assamthe author

modi   amit shah s bjp is one economic crisis away from recreating indira gandhi s      fall
text size  a  a india s political scenario today is unprecedented. all political parties  including the bharatiya janata party  still seem dazed by the recent lok sabha election verdict.the      polls truly stand alone   there is no comparable election  nor identifiable pattern. this is not the first time results have stumped parties and pollsters  those who have been watching elections for the past four decades are familiar with political quakes. but the way social and political forces are shaping up this time is new.the bjp s domination today is complete. the coming assembly elections in maharashtra  haryana  jharkhand and delhi may stir some interest  but the results are written on the wall. the media will probably whip up some superficial suspense and social media will tango and

character of the indian polity. it was the first time the term  wave  gained political currency  with indira gandhi sweeping to power on the back of the  garibi hatao  slogan. eight months later came

the youth cannot be compared with the frenzy for narendra modi today  one common factor is the search for a drastic change by breaking the old shibboleths and the readiness to plunge into the unknown. today  a large number of indian youth may be driven by radical  anti muslim hindutva   but their life s aspirations are material  not spiritual.they might be swayed by the idea of a ram mandir in

why the congress should stop complaining about not having money
text size  a  a india s ruling bhartiya janata party is flush with funds  and we re only talking about the cash in the bank. this is not surprising. it is the big businesses that fund political parties. in their own interest  they are wise to fund the ruling party  and the party likely to win the next election. there was this time when the aam aadmi party won    of the    seats in delhi in     . i saw a miserly shopkeeper give an aap leader a generous discount.  everyone salutes the rising sun   the shopkeeper told me.it takes money to fight elections  lots of it  in white  in black and in grey. in any election in the country today  you can see that the bjp has an advantage in terms of resources. almost no party is able to match the bjp s resources    .the congress is behind by a long shot. the congress supporters rue that the big businesses give most of their political donations to the bjp. the big businesses  therefore  are to be blamed for the congress  near empty coffers  not its poor leadership  strategy or fundraising efforts. certainly  not rahul gandhi.also read  neighbourhood rwas face greater scrutiny than political parties in democratic indiaquestion is  why have the congress coffers been empty even though it ruled the country for    years from      to       and had many state governments during the period  this is even more strange when you consider that the congress lost power thanks to a long list corruption charges. there was a time when a new scam allegation would hit the manmohan singh led upa   government every week.maybe the congress and the congress led upa   was completely honest. but if the party s bank account hasn t been overflowing despite being in power for    years  something s wrong with its fundraising. fundamentally  it s the belief that returning to power is inevitable. when the people of india get fed up of modi  they will return to the good old congress  and so will the flow of money from the big businesses. if it happened in            and       why not      this theory of inevitability has been crushed by the      results with the congress party s fortunes showing no signs of improvement. if anything  they have worsened in the hindi heartland.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your

pradesh and chhattisgarh could help a bit  as might being in the treasury benches in karnataka. and that is one good reason why modi shah will seek to orchestrate operation lotus and snatch some of these governments away from the congress  hand.also read  now we know who is behind the massive funding gap between bjp and congress  the corporatesthe bjp gets money because it is able to create the perception that it is going to win the election. this money makes sure that it indeed wins the election  making big businesses donate even more to the party.in such a situation  the only way the congress and other opposition parties can attract more campaign finance is by creating the impression that they can win the election. money will come if opposition parties like the congress actually do something. it won t come by wanting to spread love  taking a foreign holiday every three months and being glued to the phone in parliament.creating this impression will actually require doing something on the ground   agitations  movements  campaigns. it will need these parties to engage with the masses  an art they seem to have lost.a lost opportunitysmall traders  for instance  were very unhappy with the modi government because their businesses were hurt badly by demonetisation and gst  as also by digitisation and globalisation. did any opposition party really try wooing the small traders  the msme owners and the baniyas  this is a community with money. it could have funded opposition parties.but our opposition parties presumed they won t be able to win this vote bank  given its commitment to the bjp rss and the hindutva ideology.but how would the opposition know without trying  if the bjp can successfully break into the vote banks of opposition parties  the latter can also do the same to the bjp. when asked if the bjp was alienating its traditional core voter base of baniyas and traders  the bjp rss leaders and workers often said  privately    where will they go  to the congress  also read  this lok sabha election has most candidates using online crowd funding for campaignsif the congress and other opposition parties had made a big effort to woo this community after gst  they could have heaped rich rewards. most of the community would still have voted for the bjp  but some would have started funding the opposition. this would have also helped create the perception that the opposition could defeat the bjp  bringing it even more money. everybody salutes the rising sun.to win such battles  and earn the trust and cheques of donors  the opposition will have to work hard on the ground  be with the people  show them that they have better solutions to their problems than the bjp. this will need spending more time on the streets and less in plush

congress needs another manmohan singh to keep rahul s seat warm. but there s no one around
text size  a  a can the nehru gandhi family find another dr manmohan singh   this time to keep the seat warm for rahul gandhi in the party this question has been on everyone s mind in political circles ever since rahul gandhi declared his intent to step down as congress president following the party s rout in the general elections. except for a brief  choreographed drama outside his residence to protest against his decision and resolutions by some state units  congressmen across the country have been quiet  albeit indifferent. it must be breaking the congress  first family s heart  for sure.withdrawing his resignation offer would expose gandhi to more barbs. but seeing it through could be fraught with risks in terms of his family s political relevance.therefore  as rahul gandhi returns from his week long jaunt abroad monday  he must begin the process to find another manmohan singh  who would be the modern day incarnate of ramayana s bharat who ruled in the name of ram s paduka  sandal  until the elder brother returned from exile   or until the next lok sabha election  in gandhi s context.but before we discuss the impossibility of this mission  it must be stated that the entire idea of someone outside the family replacing rahul gandhi as congress president is impetuous  preposterous and as hair brained as his so called democratisation move through internal elections in the youth congress and the nsui. the huge public dislike and resentment against the politics of entitlement as nurtured through dynasties is a reality  which explains the electoral losses of rahul gandhi and jyotiraditya scindia and several other congress dynasts.also read  rahul can resign as congress president  but nehru gandhi dynasty never retires nor gives upbut there is another side to it   the victories of the bjp s dynasts  be it anurag thakur  poonam mahajan  dushyant singh or varun gandhi. and if one credits the  modi wave  for their victories  what about jagan mohan reddy of the ysr congress party  the newly elected andhra pradesh chief minister is an essential dynast  who had quit the congress because the party denied him inheritance of the chief ministerial throne after his father s death. the ysr family is  in fact  the andhra version of the nehru gandhi family. yet  reddy got a massive mandate. or the badal couple s victories in punjab  even though their party  the shiromani akali dal  was routed.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowone may surmise that the public dislike for dynasts is not as much about their ancestry as about how they conduct themselves in public life. jagan reddy  for instance  was on the road for his padayatra for    months  living in villages and coming to see his family in hyderabad only on weekends. the feudal ways of the gandhis are legendary. but then a mayawati with a very humble background can have more feudal streaks than say capt. amarinder singh of the erstwhile royal family of patiala. rahul gandhi might rue his party s senior leaders seeking tickets for their sons  but could someone outside kamal nath s family win chhindwara for the congress  so  the assumption about a non dynast changing the congress party s image and fortune is simplistic. the left and the liberals who once craved for gandhi family s indulgence are gunning for rahul s head today   not because of his political follies but because they hold him responsible for at least five more years of modi s rule and their own irrelevance.one can t ignore the fact that even in its humiliating defeat the congress got the support of    crore voters    crore more than those who supported it in the      elections. of course  the congress president made many stupid mistakes. he was the only one in india   along with  perhaps  his data analytics head praveen chakravarty   who thought that a nehru gandhi family member could convince voters of narendra modi s involvement in a controversial defence deal. think of the intellectual bankruptcy in a party that was promising a review of sedition laws and the afspa when the country was celebrating the balakot air strikes.there were myriads of other instances where rahul gandhi naively played into the bjp s hands. in an ideal world  such mistakes would merit resignation. but the congress being what it is  the nehru gandhi family remains both its bane and the panacea. can you imagine even one leader outside the family who would be acceptable to all congressmen across the country also read       elections ended  dynasties  only of congress  bjp s are well and truly thrivingcongressmen have no misgivings. resigning as the congress president is not a supreme sacrifice. it would have no impact on rahul gandhi s stature or lifestyle. he will remain an spg protectee. he will continue to enjoy all the privileges he does now. and he can come back after three four years to reclaim the party presidentship ahead of the      elections. or  if he still finds that responsibility cumbersome  he can just remain the party s prime ministerial candidate. come to think of it  in the intervening period  there would no public scrutiny of his conduct. he could choose to attend a parliament session or just continue his prolonged stays at exotic locations. and whenever he would happen to visit india  he would enjoy all powers without responsibility. so  why wear the crown of thorns as congress president and face the heat and dust to re build the party when there are better options available that brings us back to the main question  can the family find another manmohan singh  the name has many connotations  selflessness  lack of ambition  perpetual show of gratitude  acquiescence  forbearance and always at your service attitude. look around. there is only one dr manmohan singh. and he is    years old now.not that there is any dearth of family loyalists. if there is another person sonia gandhi could trust her family s future with  it is ahmed patel  her former political secretary who has looked after the family s interests since rajiv gandhi s time. but a party of  janeudhari hindus  may prefer other options.there are not many available as the requirements or criteria set by the family for its regents   as fulfilled by manmohan singh in the prime minister s office and as expected from the next congress president  are too difficult to match. there are many senior congress leaders such as siddaramaiah  bhupinder singh hooda  digvijaya singh  amarinder singh  even sachin pilot   and not to forget bhupesh baghel of chhattisgarh   with proven record as leaders who can shake up the moribund organisational machinery at the grassroots.also read  do young dynasts appeal to new gen voters or are they also practising outdated politics but rahul gandhi may not feel secure about handing over the organisation to ambitious leaders   even less so about the competent ones. therefore  he has only three options.first  he can pick up anyone of his cronies to keep the seat warm for him. but he may then also run the risk of driving the organisation further into the cesspool  blighting the prospects of his ascension to power.second  elevate his sister priyanka gandhi vadra to the top position in the party. although she didn t have a glittering start to her political career as the general secretary in charge of eastern uttar pradesh  her elevation would bring a whiff of change and enthuse demoralised party workers. rahul gandhi can live with the uncertainties of what would happen if his sister transforms the organisation completely and emerges as a powerful leader. but  another nehru gandhi family member at the helm could only accentuate prevailing cynicism about dynasts.the third option for rahul gandhi is to withdraw his resignation offer  publicly accept his failures instead of seeking to shift the blame onto others  and get down to re building the party organisation  starting with a new team of advisors who keep their ears to the ground.in the given circumstance  the third option sounds reasonable but rahul gandhi is known to spring surprises.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a

congress still doesn t know what has hit it. rahul will have to be the gandhi india needs
text size  a  a most indians have a somewhat love hate relationship with the nehru gandhi dynasty. first  there are those who intensely love to hate the dynasty but still think that the congress is without an identity unless there is someone from the family in charge of its affairs. then there are intellectuals like ramachandra guha or pop writers like chetan bhagat who say that the congress must be made  dynasty mukt  for it to become a genuine opposition party.it is widely believed that the congress rout is a reflection of the total rejection of the dynasty regime and the entitlement it has enjoyed. quite a few second  or third rung congress leaders believe so as well. the congress  identity and its negative  dynasty  dimension was not so pronounced when narendra modi captured the imagination of the national populace through a blitzkrieg in the media  which led a campaign of its own to run down rahul gandhi.indeed  the media enjoyed  lynching  him in tv studio debates or in newspaper columns. rahul gandhi had no friends in the media  and none among the intellectuals   neither in the khan market nor in the lutyens  delhi. but somehow  the congress  fortunes have always been linked with the family. and so  despite the hostile press and non acceptance among india s elites  rahul gandhi went ahead with his tireless campaigns. a relative win in gujarat  followed by victories in madhya pradesh  chhattisgarh and rajasthan changed his media profile  albeit only so slightly. his credibility as  pm material  and the ability to lead the congress party was still judged as unconvincing.what the congress party and its leadership under rahul gandhi did not fully comprehend was that modi had led a political  historical and ideological attack. the modi blitzkrieg had singled out the  dynasty  for its strikes. the bjp was not averse to congress leaders   it was welcoming and embracing anyone who cared to toe the sangh s ideology. the bjp s target was the  dynasty    the family   and not the party. and that is perhaps because the bjp still believes that the congress party will die with the political demise of the family.also read  rahul can resign as congress president  but nehru gandhi dynasty never retires nor gives upthis belief should explain modi s no holds barred attack not only on sonia and rahul  but also on jawaharlal nehru. after his third victory in gujarat  when modi decided to run for prime ministership  he systematically began to break the hold of the nehru gandhi image in the country. it was part of the grand strategy to finish the congress at its ideological and political core. to a great extent  this strategy has been a success. today  those in the age group of    to    have no understanding of the post independence nehruvian era. the arrival of the social media  almost aligned to modi s strategised campaign  served as a great bonanza.in response  the congress has had no media strategy worth the name. it did not recognise the power of this new medium. the bjp  under modi and his global corporate planners  set up hundreds of it cells to generate social media messages   of misinformation and disinformation. the birth of so called  troll armies  was not spontaneous. huge money was pumped to create them. by the time congress leaders found the spread out tentacles of the social media  it was too late. even now  the party is far behind in the game.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowthe congress had forgotten its own past  achievements and its ring leaders. the party never conducted study circles  never educated the cadre about the leadership of nehru and indira gandhi or about the difficult circumstances they had to work in. neither the party history  nor the country s turbulent past was ever explained to them. even the leaders  at the national or state level  were ignorant.in that political vacuum  narendra modi and his campaign handlers netted aggressively. initially  in the modi driven campaign  nehru had made  mistakes . as the campaign gained foothold  nehru became the ultimate villain. now  he is readily described as the one responsible for everything   from secularism to planning  partition to kashmir  arunachal to defeat in the sino indian war.also read  not gandhi dynasty  but a narasimha rao like figure can save the congress nowduring the national democratic alliance  nda  government under atal bihari vajpayee  nehru was neither considered an unmitigated villain nor the congress was regarded as the party that ruled and ruined the country for nearly    years. but modi chose to attack the  root  of the dynasty image and  soul  of the congress party.the campaign was helped by the congress culture of complacence  convenience and comfort  the culture that had now been shaken to the core. but it would seem that the congress has still not understood what has hit them.ahead of the results of the      look sabha elections  rahul gandhi  in an interview to ndtv  had said that the party was organisationally weak. perhaps  he was comparing the party s organisational strength to that of the rss. priyanka gandhi  after the results  castigated the party workers for not doing enough for the candidates. she even accused them of having actually worked against the party. she not only admonished them but also warned them of consequences.the congress appeared to have fallen in the trap. instead of confronting the bjp politically and ideologically  the party has gone on the defensive. it has lost the     year old historical script. it had never advocated the idea of secularism as inclusive politics. many in the party succumbed to the bjp propaganda that the congress was a pro muslim party.also read  why the congress party should stop apologising about dynastythe entire glorious past of their national and patriotic leaders  their sacrifice in the freedom struggle was reduced to  pro muslimism  and  pro pakistan . in that atmosphere  it was easy for the hindutva brigades to convert godse into a hero. this is an ideological attack  which the party could not fight back.rahul gandhi will have to follow  in letter and spirit  the footsteps of mahatma gandhi. if he gives up the encumbrances of the party presidentship  he would be free to start his  long march  from kanyakumari to kashmir and from kutch to kolkata.rahul gandhi does not have to give his family an image makeover. he has to sow afresh the seeds that turn the congress into a truly liberal  secular  compassionate party with global vision. the idea of india is indeed the idea of the congress.if the congress does not recover from its shock and awe  and stop the modi shah juggernaut from moving ahead with its not so hidden agenda of creating a hindu rashtra  then sooner rather than later we will have godse on currency notes and savarkar declared as the father of the nation.the author is a former editor and congress member of rajya sabha. views are personal.subscribe to our channels on

   lessons from jagan mohan reddy s campaign for rahul gandhi
text size  a  a much like rahul gandhi  jagan mohan reddy of andhra pradesh reached a political nadir in     .it was an election he should ideally have won  riding on the sympathy wave following his father s death in a helicopter crash in      and the manner in which the congress high command in delhi clipped his wings when he rebelled. he was arrested over corruption charges and spent    months in jail.but he was seen as a corrupt dynast  an arrogant young leader who listened to none. in contrast  in that      election  his opponent nara chandrababu naidu projected himself as the experienced leader  exactly what andhra pradesh needed after bi furcation. jagan s yuvajana sramika rythu congress party  ysrcp  also suffered from a weak  moribund party organisation.matters got worse after the election  as many of his party mps and mlas defected to naidu s telugu desam party  tdp . jagan even lost a prestigious bypoll in a ysrcp stronghold in      despite camping there for    days.from such a low  jagan went on to become the chief minister with his party securing a    ths majority in the assembly and winning    of the    lok sabha seats  in less than two years. in contrast  the congress under rahul gandhi is almost at the same nadir as it was in     . here s what rahul could learn from jagan.also read  rahul can resign as congress president  but nehru gandhi dynasty never retires nor gives upstructured campaign  jagan mohan reddy carried out a campaign for two years that was designed and structured two years in advance. with the exception of rafale  rahul gandhi didn t seem to have a plan in the last five years. he was seen running from one state election to another  sometimes doing a farmers  agitation and at other times talking about love and hate. but mostly he jumped from one topic to another  responding to the agenda set by the narendra modi government and the bjp. a structured campaign takes into consideration one s strengths  weaknesses  opportunities and threats and plans for everything in advance. jagan s yatra  for instance  was designed to shed his arrogant dynast tag by making him work hard on the ground and mingle with people. hear the people  before jagan mohan reddy started his long praja sankalp yatra  prashant kishor led indian political action committee carried out a massive survey across the state to figure out the biggest issues that concerned most people. nine issues were chosen  described as jagan s navaratnalu. women wanted prohibition  so it was there. rahul gandhi  on the other hand  decided that corruption and poverty alleviation were the biggest issues  so he campaigned around rafale and nyay. positive campaign  narendra modi s greatest strength is his image. so  rahul proceeded to  rip that strength to pieces . the results show he didn t quite succeed at that. jagan mohan reddy  in contrast  didn t spend most of his energy in destroying his opponent chandrababu naidu s image. instead  he carried out a positive campaign. for two years  he and his party made sure every voter in andhra pradesh heard of the nine things jagan mohan reddy would do to improve their lives after becoming the chief minister. starting early  the nyay campaign was launched a few days before polling began. congress alliances were being discussed till the last day of filing nominations. the big anti incumbency campaign  rafale  was launched in modi s last year in power. priyanka gandhi s debut in mass politics was announced weeks before the election. the congress has made a habit of doing too little  too late. in contrast  jagan mohan reddy started his campaign two years before the      elections. consistency and persistence  rahul gandhi did a campaign in uttar pradesh around farmers in mid       and then abandoned it suddenly. the result was that the bjp announced a farm loan waiver in its manifesto and won the day. rahul couldn t even take credit. similarly  rahul gandhi and the wider opposition stopped mobilising public sentiment against demonetisation just because it didn t work early on. when jagan mohan reddy started his yatra in       the response in the first three districts was underwhelming. but gradually it picked up  eventually looking like a mass movement. results take persistence  something rahul gandhi did learn with rafale. creating cadres overnight  jagan mohan reddy s ysrcp barely existed on the ground. in contrast  naidu s telugu desam party had a very strong organisation. he took pride in his booth management. jagan appointed a campaign coordinator for every booth who would be given the assembly ticket if s he could get    workers per booth. against the impossible target  they managed an average of   . the lists of booth workers were verified by i pac  and workers were given verifiable campaign tasks. where they failed  the coordinators were changed. incidentally  kishor had tried doing the same for the congress in uttar pradesh in       but the party didn t follow through. mobilise existing supporters  the congress party had nearly    crore voters in      but did little to enthuse them  or use them to spread the word about the congress  ideas  ideals or promises. jagan mohan reddy s campaign saw party workers reach out to existing supporters and make them a part of the  ysr family . lakhs of supporters were identified and used to create a positive public mood for jagan. digital ecosystem  a massive digital ecosystem was created for the ysrcp by i pac. party workers were asked to add at least     people from every booth to a whatsapp group. videos and images from jagan s yatra would be amplified through these whatsapp groups every day  making it irrelevant whether and how the mainstream media was covering the yatra. through booth workers  a call centre and online campaigning  an army of thousands of online volunteers was created. people were called to do the smallest of things to show support  like a page  share a post  share a video with friends  and so on.in contrast  the congress hasn t been able to create much of a digital delivery pipeline  even as it has learnt the importance of online messaging. lay traps for the opponent  jagan mohan reddy knew that chandrababu naidu would play the delhi card when he sees he is in trouble. so  when naidu played the card  positioning himself against modi to demand the special category status for andhra pradesh  jagan started protests on the issue and asked his mps to resign. this left naidu with no option but to leave the nda. the delhi card thus played out in      itself  and not closer to the election. rahul gandhi similarly needed to lay traps for modi. the hug did come close to that  but it was a one day wonder. pinning modi down to campaign in varanasi by making priyanka fight against him  for instance  could have been one such trap. media bashing  the sakshi media group is aligned with the ysrcp  but most of the media was seen as pro tdp. jagan boycotted them all  calling them practitioners of yellow journalism  a reference to the tdp s official party colour. like modi and trump  many politicians have shown that delegitimising the media helps them create and sustain their own narrative. the congress complained of the media being pro modi  but it didn t have a strategy to counter this. the congress boycotted a few channels  but senior leaders gave them interviews anyway.also read  how rahul gandhi could have defeated narendra modiviews are personal.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis

rahul can resign as congress president  but nehru gandhi dynasty never retires nor gives up
text size  a  a nobody knows for sure whether rahul gandhi will stay the course. it is not a question that can be answered by either psychoanalysis or speculation. he is aware of the gravity of the political situation and understands the malaise in the congress party.the old guard and the young brigade across several states are insisting that he must reconsider his decision to quit as congress president.the overall impression in the media is that he is merely putting up an act and will be back in the saddle soon. some others feel that he is irrationally or irresponsibly stubborn. a few  rahul watchers  say that he is sulking  mainly because of his frustration with losing amethi.columnists like pritish nandy have strongly argued that he must continue as congress chief. strangely  they feel that the party needs a nehru gandhi family member at the helm.there are others  like intellectual historian ramachandra guha  who have stridently demanded his resignation. lord meghnad desai has said that rahul gandhi must quit politics for good and settle abroad.also read  not gandhi dynasty  but a narasimha rao like figure can save the congress nownon nehru gandhi members on topthe question that is often raised about the future of the congress is  can the party survive if a nehru gandhi member is not at the top we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowthe first time this question was asked was when jawaharlal nehru was alive and in action. in       w. hangen in his     page book titled  after nehru  who    offered several names who could succeed nehru. the idea of a so called  dynasty  had not crystallised then. in       lal bahadur shastri succeeded nehru as india s prime minister  not indira gandhi.it is important to note that there have been several congress presidents from non nehru gandhi family   neelam sanjeeva reddy  december      to may        s. nijalingappa            jagjivan ram              shankar dayal sharma              d.k. barooah              k. brahmananda reddy

were defeated. many analysts had then said that it was a  second independence  under the leadership of a  second mahatma   jayaprakash narayan. they were sure that the  nehru era  was over with the comprehensive defeat of the mother and son. few even thought that the country had been freed from the yoke of the congress rule   congress mukt  was a term that was not in vogue then .dynasty revived by arch foesif the  peoples  revolution   as the janata party s victory in      was described by some  had not collapsed within the next three years  the  dynasty  would have ended then and there. but the  dynasty  was revived by its arch foes.also read  why the congress party should stop apologising about dynastycharan singh challenged the morarji desai government and toppled it in     . he took indira gandhi s support and became prime minister. the deal between indira and charan singh was struck by sanjay. later  indira gandhi withdrew her outside support to the charan singh government and it collapsed.the      lok sabha election brought indira gandhi back to power.it was indira gandhi s assassination that brought rajiv gandhi into limelight. sonia gandhi was fiercely opposed to rajiv taking over as the pm  my years with indira gandhi by p.c. alexander . if sonia was keen to continue the  dynasty   she would not have opposed rajiv gandhi becoming the pm.it is amusing that neither varun gandhi nor his mother maneka gandhi is ever accused of carrying forward the dynasty.they find prominence in the bjp essentially because they are members of the nehru gandhi family. if instead of sonia gandhi  the family baton was passed on to maneka  then would it not have been described as dynastic succession recognition for dynastyafter rajiv gandhi s assassination in may       there was no nehru gandhi member at the top of the congress for nearly seven years. almost immediately after rajiv s assassination  the entire congress working committee had unanimously decided to make sonia gandhi the party president. she politely but firmly refused.it was after the defeat of the narasimha rao government in      and the collapse of three successive governments  vajpayee s    day government followed by deve gowda and i.k. gujral s short stints as prime ministers  that sonia decided to join active politics in december     .if in those seven years  the stars in the congress  like sharad pawar  madhavrao scindia and digvijaya singh  had established their leadership within the party  sonia gandhi would not have joined  or they would not have felt it necessary to request her to come and take charge of the party. so again  the  dynasty  did not impose itself on the party  but was urged by the top leadership to rescue the party from further decline.also read  the political dynasty nobody is talking about  sardar patel ssonia gandhi had failed to lead her party to success in      and      elections. she was labelled a failure. the opposition and the media condemned and ridiculed her for her accent  for being a foreigner and for not understanding a complex country like india.  the same commentators later called her sagacious  confident and even statesman like .the congress could have dumped her as sharad pawar indeed tried in       by splitting the party on the question of her foreign origin and creating a new outfit  the nationalist congress party  ncp . but pawar s breakaway group could not inspire confidence and except for a few  most congress leaders remained with the sonia gandhi led party.in sonia gandhi s nearly two decade long tenure as congress president  the  dynasty  tag became a stigma. although there was criticism against sanjay gandhi in the     s and rajiv gandhi in the     s  dynasty was either accepted as part and parcel of realpolitik or tolerated because  there was no alternative .in       when the bjp thought that sonia gandhi would become the prime minister  all hell broke loose   sushma swaraj threatened to shave her head in protest while uma bharti said it  will be the darkest day in the history  of india if sonia became the pm.sonia s refusal to become the pm made her a living legend and later the one wielding the  remote control  of the manmohan singh government. the alleged indirect  dynastic control  was condemned  but the political class also took it in its stride. all parties  including the bjp  always looked up to sonia  even when manmohan singh was the prime minister. it was a kind of recognition for the  dynasty .revival   survivalthe term  dynasty   however  became an expression of virulent abuse and disgust only after rahul gandhi took to the political stage. for the last    years  rahul has been the target of the opposition and the media. he has been viciously ridiculed and derided as unintelligent. he has been widely abused on the social media. prime minister narendra modi almost took a wicked pleasure  like a bully in school  in running down the persona of rahul gandhi. perhaps  no other person has suffered the kind of humiliation that rahul has.and yet  from akhilesh yadav to uddhav thackeray  from m.k. stalin and kanimozhi to y.s. jagan mohan reddy  sukhbir singh badal and omar abdullah  everyone is party of dynastic politics. but the national condemnation and barbs are reserved only for the gandhis.also read  smriti irani s makeover  from being most disliked modi minister to dynasty slayer in amethithe indian national congress is currently in dire straits  but still enjoys a vast following among people and has a legacy of over     years. it can revive itself and survive with or without the nehru gandhi dynasty. if the congress could march ahead after nehru s death and indira and rajiv gandhi s assassination  falling and rising again  why can t it do the same after rahul gandhi s resignation but rahul has made it amply clear that he is not retiring from politics  to oblige lord meghnad desai  nor running away from the mission he has

ambedkar knew about cartoons trolling him and he blamed  congress press  for it
text size  a  a b.r. ambedkar was the subject of many cartoons in his lifetime. but why should they matter to india six decades after the man has died  it is because ambedkar is seen through a very different prism today and the toxic lampooning he was subjected to continues to date for dalit leaders like mayawati.a new book by a young researcher from the department of arts and aesthetics  jnu  compiles these cartoons on ambedkar  which were lying in dusty archives and news clippings  to show not much has changed. unnamati syama sundar  who is a cartoonist and signs off as syam  in his book  no laughing matter  the ambedkar cartoons            took pains to scratch beneath the surface and locate the meaning and biases in these     cartoons.ambedkar himself knew about the casteist and sexist cartoons and chose to respond to them. he criticised the media for being one sided and a  congress press . in       when he was asked to deliver a lecture on the    st birthday of govind ranade  ambedkar said   i know the congress press well. i attach no value to its criticism. it has never refuted my arguments. it knows only  how  to criticise  rebuke and revile me for everything i do  and to misreport  misrepresent and pervert everything i say. nothing that i do pleases the congress press. also read  dragging dead buffalo to wearing sari  how ambedkar was trolled by casteist cartoonistsncert controversysyam s collection of cartoons comes in the backdrop of the      controversy about an ambedkar cartoon in the ncert political science textbook. an mp protested against the cartoon saying it was offensive to ambedkar and dalits. the cartoon  drawn by keshav shankar pillai  showed an impatient nehru standing with a whip behind a snail called  constitution . the snail was being driven by ambedkar. the cartoon was meant to depict nehru s frustration with the pace of the constituent assembly drawing up the constitution.the controversy resulted in the ncert dropping the cartoon from the book and the resignation of yogendra yadav and suhas palshikar from the advisory board. if you are interested to know what yadav thinks about this controversy after seven years  you may like to read his recent article in theprint.also read  columbia university teaches ambedkar s biography  but few in india have even read itwe are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowno laughing matterby digging out     cartoons from different publications and putting them in the context of intersections of history and biography  syam uses discursive methods of encoding and decoding propounded by stuart hall  to find meaning in them. according to hall s theory  the audience derives their own meaning from media texts. these meanings can be dominant  negotiated or oppositional depending on her position in society. syam is able to see  due to his social and cultural location and academic training  what many of us may not see in those cartoons.for many of us  the cartoons on ambedkar can be funny or even benign commentary  but not for the author and may be not so for million others in india.these cartoons come at a significant time when iconography of ambedkar is the trend and many hagiographic accounts are being written about him  and when the government of the day  despite not being comfortable with his ideology  has developed huge structures   panchatirth  five important places in the life of ambedkar  don t miss the usage of the word tirth    dedicated to him. this is also the time when his famous treaties like annihilation of caste and riddles in hinduism have gone missing from the shelves of government publishers.also read  how gandhi made ambedkar a villain in his fight to be the real representative of dalitscartoon to lampoonit is interesting that the first cartoon on ambedkar appeared in       at the time of the debate on communal awards  poona pact and separate electorates. by then ambedkar had accomplished many feats and led many movements. he was in public life since     . in       he started publishing his journal mook nayak. in       he led mahad satyagraha to secure the rights of the dalits to drink water from public tanks. that same year he burnt the manusmriti. two years later  he submitted a memorandum to the simon commission emphasising the political rights of the  low  castes. in       he led the kalaram temple entry movement in nasik. in       he participated in the second round table conference. up until the     s  ambedkar was not a subject of vilification by media or cartoonists. only when he became the head of the constituent assembly and a national face  did these cartoons crop up. that s the art of killing by silencing.in his introduction to the book  syam cautions the reader   in the ambedkar cartoons  he is often the villain  often the smallest man in the frame  often an object of derision. no laughing matter is not another milquetoast commemorative volume. double edged  this book presents to the public the very cartoons that seem unfair to the subject beloved to it  it mocks the very images it dusts up from the archives and presses back into circulation.  in a nutshell  if you love ambedkar  and if you read this book  get ready to be offended and the angry at the same time.to see how cartooning can be a hegemonic act  one can still compile the cartoons on v.p. singh during the mandal commission agitation         or the cartoons on arjun singh  when he introduced the obc quota        in higher educational institutions. you will also see similar traits in the caricatures of mayawati and lalu prasad.if we go by the cartoons in no laughing matter  most of them appeared in the publications that supported the congress.one of the most offensive cartoons in the book  page      appeared in the rss mouthpiece organiser  in which cartoonist ravindra depicts ambedkar as a kidnapper of upper caste woman for championing the hindu code bill. in that cartoon titled  ambedkar rides an ass of a bill   he is shown riding a donkey  holding a woman in an inappropriate manner and taking her towards a ditch. the horror on the face of the lady is drawn as if indian women were opposed to ideas like getting inheritance rights or doing away with bigamy and polygamy  or having the right to divorce.also read  you can be a hindu nationalist and an ambedkarite bothambedkar knewambedkar was well aware of how the media portrayed him.citing the possible reasons for the hostile attitude of the press towards him  ambedkar said   this animosity of the congress press towards me can to my mind  not unfairly  be explained as a reflex of the hatred of the hindus for the untouchables however strong and however filthy be the abuses which the congress press chooses to shower on me  i must do my duty. i am no worshipper of idols. i believe in breaking them. this is why ambedkar always tried to have his own publications like mook nayak  the leader of the voiceless   bahiskrit bharat  the excluded india   samata  equality   janata  people  and prabuddh bharat  enlightened india . however  due to paucity of funds  most of these publications died early. the publications were no match for the mainstream  big business owned press with bigger circulation.like ambedkar said   with the press in hand  it is easy to manufacture great men. however  syam s book goes a long way to show that the media and cartoonists do not only make great men  but sometimes villains too. it is altogether another matter that their one time villain has now become the subject of hagiography even by his detractors.the

modi   amit shah s bjp is one economic crisis away from recreating indira gandhi s      fall
text size  a  a india s political scenario today is unprecedented. all political parties  including the bharatiya janata party  still seem dazed by the recent lok sabha election verdict.the      polls truly stand alone   there is no comparable election  nor identifiable pattern. this is not the first time results have stumped parties and pollsters  those who have been watching elections for the past four decades are familiar with political quakes. but the way social and political forces are shaping up this time is new.the bjp s domination today is complete. the coming assembly elections in maharashtra  haryana  jharkhand and delhi may stir some interest  but the results are written on the wall. the media will probably whip up some superficial suspense and social media will tango and troll  but the mystery is gone.it is not as if the so called observers and experts have been able to decipher this. while there has been much  psychoanalysis  of prime minister narendra modi and union home minister amit shah  there has hardly been any mapping of what the next five years might be like.can history predict the future indira gandhi s stunning victory in march      did change the character of the indian polity. it was the first time the term  wave  gained political currency  with indira gandhi sweeping to power on the back of the  garibi hatao  slogan. eight months later came the bangladesh liberation war  further cementing indira s status.but just two years after that  india was hit by an economic crisis following the sharp rise in global crude oil prices. this was further compounded by the  century s worst drought   leading to widespread famine.also read  the gujarat model  why amit shah was always going to be modi s pick for home ministerwe are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowmassive social unrest followed  bringing to the national stage the phenomenon called jayaprakash narayan  jp . political confrontation between jp and indira  and the structural deadlock between the state and the emerging forces led to the emergency.indira s authoritarianism is often compared with modi s autocratic style. but the two leaders  as also their times  are very different.indira and sanjay gandhi s defeat in raebareli and amethi in march      was shocking  but the polity was not drastically changed. the jp movement and the janata party were rooted in the overall congress culture. jayaprakash provided continuity to the legacy of the freedom movement and then prime minister morarji desai with jagjivan ram reflected the congress ethos.although the jp movement s popularity among the youth cannot be compared with the frenzy for narendra modi today  one common factor is the search for a drastic change by breaking the old shibboleths and the readiness to plunge into the unknown. today  a large number of indian youth may be driven by radical  anti muslim hindutva   but their life s aspirations are material  not spiritual.they might be swayed by the idea of a ram mandir in ayodhya  influenced by polarised sentiments  but frenzies by definition are like tides. the strong tidal waves do create fright  but once they start retreating  the stark reality of the coastal damage and disruption caused by them becomes visible.also read  amit shah is the  prime  minister in modi cabinet   he hits where it hurtsparty will need new causesthe coming assembly elections may provide an interregnum of sorts  but once they are over  the economic cyclone and the financial institutional crash will become visible. raids by the enforcement directorate or the income tax department on the vadras and the chidambarams may help score some brownie points  but they won t hide the non performing assets of the banks.further attacks on the congress or the nehru gandhi family will not rescue the bjp from political twisters  since the congress will not be seen as a political challenge anyway. the party s position is similar to one of confusion and puzzlement while regaining consciousness after being in a state of coma.the looming economic disaster can t be overcome by hindutva  or by blaming indian muslims or by accusing pakistan of supporting terrorism.campaigns against  love jihad  or  anti national  intellectuals will cease to have the sting. elections in west bengal may provide some space for violent communal polarisation  but its life span will be limited.the shock therapies like demonetisation or even surgical strikes will not make headlines anymore. bringing back vijay mallya or nirav modi may get some dramatic moments for the likes of arnab goswamis and rajat sharmas  but fewer and fewer viewers will tune in for the dead horse stories.the invincible duo and new  hindu emperors   narendra modi and amit shah  will have no such helplines   the congress  rahul gandhi  hindutva  pakistan   to play the game. their  skills  in headline management or theatrical foreign trips will lose colour.also read  time modi   amit shah stop abusing lutyens  delhi. they are the new power elite in capitalthe known and the unknownwhatever happens  the bjp will not split. the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh  rss  will retain its hold over many institutions. the election commission will continue to be tame. the judiciary will remain cooperative and responsible  as recent communications between the chief justice of india and the prime minister show. the reserve bank of india will play ball in cutting or not cutting interest rates. the central bureau of investigation  cbi  will be cooperative like the ed and the i t department. the media  by and large  will remain embedded.what no one can predict are the various international configurations. what us president donald trump will do and how global trade will affect india s imports and exports. what will pakistan or its non state actors do and how india will react. what will happen in our neighbourhood and how china will impact the world and india.the spectre of anarchy cannot be wished away by the oratorical skills of narendra modi  the ruthless strategies of amit shah and nsa ajit doval or even the diplomatic trapeze of foreign minister s. jaishankar.the country has been plunged into an uncertain future  even as its past is being reconstructed. that is perhaps the reason why the political class and the experts appear bewildered. they  too  have entered the dark cave without a

why the congress should stop complaining about not having money
text size  a  a india s ruling bhartiya janata party is flush with funds  and we re only talking about the cash in the bank. this is not surprising. it is the big businesses that fund political parties. in their own interest  they are wise to fund the ruling party  and the party likely to win the next election. there was this time when the aam aadmi party won    of the    seats in delhi in     . i saw a miserly shopkeeper give an aap leader a generous discount.  everyone salutes the rising sun   the shopkeeper told me.it takes money to fight elections  lots of it  in white  in black and in grey. in any election in the country today  you can see that the bjp has an advantage in terms of resources. almost no party is able to match the bjp s resources    .the congress is behind by a long shot. the congress supporters rue that the big businesses give most of their political donations to the bjp. the big businesses  therefore  are to be blamed for the congress  near empty coffers  not its poor leadership  strategy or fundraising efforts. certainly  not rahul gandhi.also read  neighbourhood rwas face greater scrutiny than political parties in democratic indiaquestion is  why have the congress coffers been empty even though it ruled the country for    years from      to       and had many state governments during the period  this is even more strange when you consider that the congress lost power thanks to a long list corruption charges. there was a time when a new scam allegation would hit the manmohan singh led upa   government every week.maybe the congress and the

happened in            and       why not      this theory of inevitability has been crushed by the      results with the congress party s fortunes showing no signs of improvement. if anything  they

these governments away from the congress  hand.also read  now we know who is behind the massive funding gap between bjp and congress  the corporatesthe bjp gets money because it is able to create the perception that it is going to win the election. this money makes sure that it indeed wins the election  making big businesses donate even more to the party.in such a situation  the only way the congress and other opposition parties can attract more campaign finance is by creating the impression that they can win the election. money will come if opposition parties like the congress actually do something. it won t come by wanting to spread love  taking a foreign holiday every three months and being glued to the phone in parliament.creating this impression will actually require doing something on the ground   agitations  movements  campaigns. it will need these parties to engage with the masses  an art they seem to have lost.a lost opportunitysmall traders  for instance  were very unhappy with the modi government because their businesses were hurt badly by demonetisation and gst  as also by digitisation and globalisation. did any opposition party really try wooing the small traders  the msme owners and the baniyas  this is a community with money. it could have funded opposition parties.but our opposition parties presumed they won t be able to win this vote bank  given its commitment to the bjp rss and the hindutva ideology.but how would the opposition know without trying  if the bjp can successfully break into the vote banks of opposition parties  the latter can also do the same to the bjp. when asked if the bjp was alienating its traditional core voter base of baniyas and traders  the bjp rss leaders and workers often said  privately    where will they go  to the congress  also read  this lok sabha election has most candidates using online crowd funding for campaignsif the congress and other opposition parties had made a big effort to woo this community after gst  they could have heaped rich rewards. most of the community would still have voted for the bjp  but some would have started funding the opposition. this would have also helped create the perception that the opposition could defeat the bjp  bringing it even more money. everybody salutes the rising sun.to win such battles  and earn the trust and cheques of donors  the opposition will have to work hard on the ground  be with the people  show them that they have better solutions to their problems than the bjp. this will need spending more time on the streets and less in plush

congress needs another manmohan singh to keep rahul s seat warm. but there s no one around
text size  a  a can the nehru gandhi family find another dr manmohan singh   this time to keep the seat warm for rahul gandhi in the party this question has been on everyone s mind in political circles ever since rahul gandhi declared his intent to step down as congress president following the party s rout in the general elections. except for a brief  choreographed drama outside his residence to protest against his decision and resolutions by some state units  congressmen across the country have been quiet  albeit indifferent. it must be breaking the congress  first family s heart  for sure.withdrawing his resignation offer would expose gandhi to more barbs. but seeing it through could be fraught with risks in terms of his family s political relevance.therefore  as rahul gandhi returns from his week long jaunt abroad monday  he must begin the process to find another manmohan singh  who would be the modern day incarnate of ramayana s bharat who ruled in the name of ram s paduka  sandal  until the elder brother returned from exile   or until the next lok sabha election  in gandhi s context.but before we discuss the impossibility of this mission  it must be stated that the entire idea of someone outside the family replacing rahul gandhi as congress president is impetuous  preposterous and as hair brained as his so called democratisation move through internal elections in the youth congress and the nsui. the huge public dislike and resentment against the politics of entitlement as nurtured through dynasties is a reality  which explains the electoral losses of rahul gandhi and jyotiraditya scindia and several other congress dynasts.also read  rahul can resign as congress president  but nehru gandhi dynasty never retires nor gives upbut there is another side to it   the victories of the bjp s dynasts  be it anurag thakur  poonam mahajan  dushyant singh or varun gandhi. and if one credits the  modi wave  for their victories  what about jagan mohan reddy of the ysr congress party  the newly elected andhra pradesh chief minister is an essential dynast  who had quit the congress because the party denied him inheritance of the chief ministerial throne after his father s death. the ysr family is  in fact  the andhra version of the nehru gandhi family. yet  reddy got a massive mandate. or the badal couple s victories in punjab  even though their party  the shiromani akali dal  was routed.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowone may surmise that the public dislike for dynasts is not as much about their ancestry as about how they conduct themselves in public life. jagan reddy  for instance  was on the road for his padayatra for    months  living in villages and coming to see his family in hyderabad only on weekends. the feudal ways of the gandhis are legendary. but then a mayawati with a very humble background can have more feudal streaks than say capt. amarinder singh of the erstwhile royal family of patiala. rahul gandhi might rue his party s senior leaders seeking tickets for their sons  but could someone outside kamal nath s family win chhindwara for the congress  so  the assumption about a non dynast changing the congress party s image and fortune is simplistic. the left and the liberals who once craved for gandhi family s indulgence are gunning for rahul s head today   not because of his political follies but because they hold him responsible for at least five more years of modi s rule and their own irrelevance.one can t ignore the fact that even in its humiliating defeat the congress got the support of    crore voters    crore more than those who supported it in the      elections. of course  the congress president made many stupid mistakes. he was the only one in india   along with  perhaps  his data analytics head praveen chakravarty   who thought that a nehru gandhi family member could convince voters of narendra modi s involvement in a controversial defence deal. think of the intellectual bankruptcy in a party that was promising a review of sedition laws and the afspa when the country was celebrating the balakot air strikes.there were myriads of other instances where rahul gandhi naively played into the bjp s hands. in an ideal world  such mistakes would merit resignation. but the congress being what it is  the nehru gandhi family remains both its bane and the panacea. can you imagine even one leader outside the family who would be acceptable to all congressmen across the country also read       elections ended  dynasties  only of congress  bjp s are well and truly thrivingcongressmen have no misgivings. resigning as the congress president is not a supreme sacrifice. it would have no impact on rahul gandhi s stature or lifestyle. he will remain an spg protectee. he will continue to enjoy all the privileges he does now. and he can come back after three four years to reclaim the party presidentship ahead of the      elections. or  if he still finds that responsibility cumbersome  he can just remain the party s prime ministerial candidate. come to think of it  in the intervening period  there would no public scrutiny of his conduct. he could choose to attend a parliament session or just continue his prolonged stays at exotic locations. and whenever he would happen to visit india  he would enjoy all powers without responsibility. so  why wear the crown of thorns as congress president and face the heat and dust to re build the party when there are better options available that brings us back to the main question  can the family find another manmohan singh  the name has many connotations  selflessness  lack of ambition  perpetual show of gratitude  acquiescence  forbearance and always at your service attitude. look around. there is only one dr manmohan singh. and he is    years old now.not that there is any dearth of family loyalists. if there is another person sonia gandhi could trust her family s future with  it is ahmed patel  her former political secretary who has looked after the family s interests since rajiv gandhi s time. but a party of  janeudhari hindus  may prefer other options.there are not many available as the requirements or criteria set by the family for its regents   as fulfilled by manmohan singh in the prime minister s office and as expected from the next congress president  are too difficult to match. there are many senior congress leaders such as siddaramaiah  bhupinder singh hooda  digvijaya singh  amarinder singh  even sachin pilot   and not to forget bhupesh baghel of chhattisgarh   with proven record as leaders who can shake up the moribund organisational machinery at the grassroots.also read  do young dynasts appeal to new gen voters or are they also practising outdated politics but rahul gandhi may not feel secure about handing over the organisation to ambitious leaders   even less so about the competent ones. therefore  he has only three options.first  he can pick up anyone of his cronies to keep the seat warm for him. but he may then also run the risk of driving the organisation further into the cesspool  blighting the prospects of his ascension to power.second  elevate his sister priyanka gandhi vadra to the top position in the party. although she didn t have a glittering start to her political career as the general secretary in charge of eastern uttar pradesh  her elevation would bring a whiff of change and enthuse demoralised party workers. rahul gandhi can live with the uncertainties of what would happen if his sister transforms the organisation completely and emerges as a powerful leader. but  another nehru gandhi family member at the helm could only accentuate prevailing cynicism about dynasts.the third option for rahul gandhi is to withdraw his resignation offer  publicly accept his failures instead of seeking to shift the blame onto others  and get down to re building the party organisation  starting with a new team of advisors who keep their ears to the ground.in the given circumstance  the third option sounds reasonable but rahul gandhi is known to spring surprises.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a

congress still doesn t know what has hit it. rahul will have to be the gandhi india needs
text size  a  a most indians have a somewhat love hate relationship with the nehru gandhi dynasty. first  there are those who intensely love to hate the dynasty but still think that the congress is without an identity unless there is someone from the family in charge of its affairs. then there are intellectuals like ramachandra guha or pop writers like chetan bhagat who say that the congress must be made  dynasty mukt  for it to become a genuine opposition party.it is widely believed that the congress rout is a reflection of the total rejection of the dynasty regime and the entitlement it has enjoyed. quite a few second  or third rung congress leaders believe so as well. the congress  identity and its negative  dynasty  dimension was not so pronounced when narendra modi captured the imagination of the national populace through a blitzkrieg in the media  which led a campaign of its own to run down rahul gandhi.indeed  the media enjoyed  lynching  him in tv studio debates or in newspaper columns. rahul gandhi had no friends in the media  and none among the intellectuals   neither in the khan market nor in the lutyens  delhi. but somehow  the congress  fortunes have always been linked with the family. and so  despite the hostile press and non acceptance among india s elites  rahul gandhi went ahead with his tireless campaigns. a relative win in gujarat  followed by victories in madhya pradesh  chhattisgarh and rajasthan changed his media profile  albeit only so slightly. his credibility as  pm material  and the ability to lead the congress party was still judged as unconvincing.what the congress party and its leadership under rahul gandhi did not fully comprehend was that modi had led a political  historical and ideological attack. the modi blitzkrieg had singled out the  dynasty  for its strikes. the bjp was not averse to congress leaders   it was welcoming and embracing anyone who cared to toe the sangh s ideology. the bjp s target was the  dynasty    the family   and not the party. and that is perhaps because the bjp still believes that the congress party will die with the political demise of the family.also read  rahul can resign as congress president  but nehru gandhi dynasty never retires nor gives upthis belief should explain modi s no holds barred attack not only on sonia and rahul  but also on jawaharlal nehru. after his third victory in gujarat  when modi decided to run for prime ministership  he systematically began to break the hold of the nehru gandhi image in the country. it was part of the grand strategy to finish the congress at its ideological and political core. to a great extent  this strategy has been a success. today  those in the age group of    to    have no understanding of the post independence nehruvian era. the arrival of the social media  almost aligned to modi s strategised campaign  served as a great bonanza.in response  the congress has had no media strategy worth the name. it did not recognise the power of this new medium. the bjp  under modi and his global corporate planners  set up hundreds of it cells to generate social media messages   of misinformation and disinformation. the birth of so called  troll armies  was not spontaneous. huge money was pumped to create them. by the time congress leaders found the spread out tentacles of the social media  it was too late. even now  the party is far behind in the game.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowthe congress had forgotten its own past  achievements and its ring leaders. the party never conducted study circles  never educated the cadre about the leadership of nehru and indira gandhi or about the difficult circumstances they had to work in. neither the party history  nor the country s turbulent past was ever explained to them. even the leaders  at the national or state level  were ignorant.in that political vacuum  narendra modi and his campaign handlers netted aggressively. initially  in the modi driven campaign  nehru had made  mistakes . as the campaign gained foothold  nehru became the ultimate villain. now  he is readily described as the one responsible for everything   from secularism to planning  partition to kashmir  arunachal to defeat in the sino indian war.also read  not gandhi dynasty  but a narasimha rao like figure can save the congress nowduring the national democratic alliance  nda  government under atal bihari vajpayee  nehru was neither considered an unmitigated villain nor the congress was regarded as the party that ruled and ruined the country for nearly    years. but modi chose to attack the  root  of the dynasty image and  soul  of the congress party.the campaign was helped by the congress culture of complacence  convenience and comfort  the culture that had now been shaken to the core. but it would seem that the congress has still not understood what has hit them.ahead of the results of the      look sabha elections  rahul gandhi  in an interview to ndtv  had said that the party was organisationally weak. perhaps  he was comparing the party s organisational strength to that of the rss. priyanka gandhi  after the results  castigated the party workers for not doing enough for the candidates. she even accused them of having actually worked against the party. she not only admonished them but also warned them of consequences.the congress appeared to have fallen in the trap. instead of confronting the bjp politically and ideologically  the party has gone on the defensive. it has lost the     year old historical script. it had never advocated the idea of secularism as inclusive politics. many in the party succumbed to the bjp propaganda that the congress was a pro muslim party.also read  why the congress party should stop apologising about dynastythe entire glorious past of their national and patriotic leaders  their sacrifice in the freedom struggle was reduced to  pro muslimism  and  pro pakistan . in that atmosphere  it was easy for the hindutva brigades to convert godse into a hero. this is an ideological attack  which the party could not fight back.rahul gandhi will have to follow  in letter and spirit  the footsteps of mahatma gandhi. if he gives up the encumbrances of the party presidentship  he would be free to start his  long march  from kanyakumari to kashmir and from kutch to kolkata.rahul gandhi does not have to give his family an image makeover. he has to sow afresh the seeds that turn the congress into a truly liberal  secular  compassionate party with global vision. the idea of india is indeed the idea of the congress.if the congress does not recover from its shock and awe  and stop the modi shah juggernaut from moving ahead with its not so hidden agenda of creating a hindu rashtra  then sooner rather than later we will have godse on currency notes and savarkar declared as the father of the nation.the author is a former editor and congress member of rajya sabha. views are personal.subscribe to our channels on

   lessons from jagan mohan reddy s campaign for rahul gandhi
text size  a  a much like rahul gandhi  jagan mohan reddy of andhra pradesh reached a political nadir in     .it was an election he should ideally have won  riding on the sympathy wave following his father s death in a helicopter crash in      and the manner in which the congress high command in delhi clipped his wings when he rebelled. he was arrested over corruption charges and spent    months in jail.but he was seen as a corrupt dynast  an arrogant young leader who listened to none. in contrast  in that      election  his opponent nara chandrababu naidu projected himself as the experienced leader  exactly what andhra pradesh needed after bi furcation. jagan s yuvajana sramika rythu congress party  ysrcp  also suffered from a weak  moribund party organisation.matters got worse after the election  as many of his party mps and mlas defected to naidu s telugu desam party  tdp . jagan even lost a prestigious bypoll in a ysrcp stronghold in      despite camping there for    days.from such a low  jagan went on to become the chief minister with his party securing a    ths majority in the assembly and winning    of the    lok sabha seats  in less than two years. in contrast  the congress under rahul gandhi is almost at the same nadir as it was in     . here s what rahul could learn from jagan.also read  rahul can resign as congress president  but nehru gandhi dynasty never retires nor gives upstructured campaign  jagan mohan reddy carried out a campaign for two years that was designed and structured two years in advance. with the exception of rafale  rahul gandhi didn t seem to have a plan in the last five years. he was seen running from one state election to another  sometimes doing a farmers  agitation and at other times talking about love and hate. but mostly he jumped from one topic to another  responding to the agenda set by the narendra modi government and the bjp. a structured campaign takes into consideration one s strengths  weaknesses  opportunities and threats and plans for everything in advance. jagan s yatra  for instance  was designed to shed his arrogant dynast tag by making him work hard on the ground and mingle with people. hear the people  before jagan mohan reddy started his long praja sankalp yatra  prashant kishor led indian political action committee carried out a massive survey across the state to figure out the biggest issues that concerned most people. nine issues were chosen  described as jagan s navaratnalu. women wanted prohibition  so it was there. rahul gandhi  on the other hand  decided that corruption and poverty alleviation were the biggest issues  so he campaigned around rafale and nyay. positive campaign  narendra modi s greatest strength is his image. so  rahul proceeded to  rip that strength to pieces . the results show he didn t quite succeed at that. jagan mohan reddy  in contrast  didn t spend most of his energy in destroying his opponent chandrababu naidu s image. instead  he carried out a positive campaign. for two years  he and his party made sure every voter in andhra pradesh heard of the nine things jagan mohan reddy would do to improve their lives after becoming the chief minister. starting early  the nyay campaign was launched a few days before polling began. congress alliances were being discussed till the last day of filing nominations. the big anti incumbency campaign  rafale  was launched in modi s last year in power. priyanka gandhi s debut in mass politics was announced weeks before the election. the congress has made a habit of doing too little  too late. in contrast  jagan mohan reddy started his campaign two years before the      elections. consistency and persistence  rahul gandhi did a campaign in uttar pradesh around farmers in mid       and then abandoned it suddenly. the result was that the bjp announced a farm loan waiver in its manifesto and won the day. rahul couldn t even take credit. similarly  rahul gandhi and the wider opposition stopped mobilising public sentiment against demonetisation just because it didn t work early on. when jagan mohan reddy started his yatra in       the response in the first three districts was underwhelming. but gradually it picked up  eventually looking like a mass movement. results take persistence  something rahul gandhi did learn with rafale. creating cadres overnight  jagan mohan reddy s ysrcp barely existed on the ground. in contrast  naidu s telugu desam party had a very strong organisation. he took pride in his booth management. jagan appointed a campaign coordinator for every booth who would be given the assembly ticket if s he could get    workers per booth. against the impossible target  they managed an average of   . the lists of booth workers were verified by i pac  and workers were given verifiable campaign tasks. where they failed  the coordinators were changed. incidentally  kishor had tried doing the same for the congress in uttar pradesh in       but the party didn t follow through. mobilise existing supporters  the congress party had nearly    crore voters in      but did little to enthuse them  or use them to spread the word about the congress  ideas  ideals or promises. jagan mohan reddy s campaign saw party workers reach out to existing supporters and make them a part of the  ysr family . lakhs of supporters were identified and used to create a positive public mood for jagan. digital ecosystem  a massive digital ecosystem was created for the ysrcp by i pac. party workers were asked to add at least     people from every booth to a whatsapp group. videos and images from jagan s yatra would be amplified through these whatsapp groups every day  making it irrelevant whether and how the mainstream media was covering the yatra. through booth workers  a call centre and online campaigning  an army of thousands of online volunteers was created. people were called to do the smallest of things to show support  like a page  share a post  share a video with friends  and so on.in contrast  the congress hasn t been able to create much of a digital delivery pipeline  even as it has learnt the importance of online messaging. lay traps for the opponent  jagan mohan reddy knew that chandrababu naidu would play the delhi card when he sees he is in trouble. so  when naidu played the card  positioning himself against modi to demand the special category status for andhra pradesh  jagan started protests on the issue and asked his mps to resign. this left naidu with no option but to leave the nda. the delhi card thus played out in      itself  and not closer to the election. rahul gandhi similarly needed to lay traps for modi. the hug did come close to that  but it was a one day wonder. pinning modi down to campaign in varanasi by making priyanka fight against him  for instance  could have been one such trap. media bashing  the sakshi media group is aligned with the ysrcp  but most of the media was seen as pro tdp. jagan boycotted them all  calling them practitioners of yellow journalism  a reference to the tdp s official party colour. like modi and trump  many politicians have shown that delegitimising the media helps them create and sustain their own narrative. the congress complained of the media being pro modi  but it didn t have a strategy to counter this. the congress boycotted a few channels  but senior leaders gave them interviews anyway.also read  how rahul gandhi could have defeated narendra modiviews are personal.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis

rahul can resign as congress president  but nehru gandhi dynasty never retires nor gives up
text size  a  a nobody knows for sure whether rahul gandhi will stay the course. it is not a question that can be answered by either psychoanalysis or speculation. he is aware of the gravity of the political situation and understands the malaise in the congress party.the old guard and the young brigade across several states are insisting that he must reconsider his decision to quit as congress president.the overall impression in the media is that he is merely putting up an act and will be back in the saddle soon. some others feel that he is irrationally or irresponsibly stubborn. a few  rahul watchers  say that he is sulking  mainly because of his frustration with losing amethi.columnists like pritish nandy have strongly argued that he must continue as congress chief. strangely  they feel that the party needs a nehru gandhi family member at the helm.there are others  like intellectual historian ramachandra guha  who have stridently demanded his resignation. lord meghnad desai has said that rahul gandhi must quit politics for good and settle abroad.also read  not gandhi dynasty  but a narasimha rao like figure can save the congress nownon nehru gandhi members on topthe question

jawaharlal nehru was alive and in action. in       w. hangen in his     page book titled  after nehru  who    offered several names who could succeed nehru. the idea of a so called  dynasty  had not crystallised then. in       lal bahadur shastri succeeded nehru as india s prime minister  not indira gandhi.it is important to note that there have been several congress presidents from non nehru gandhi family   neelam sanjeeva reddy  december      to may        s. nijalingappa            jagjivan ram              shankar dayal sharma              d.k. barooah              k. brahmananda reddy

were defeated. many analysts had then said that it was a  second independence  under the leadership of a  second mahatma   jayaprakash narayan. they were sure that the  nehru era  was over with the comprehensive defeat of the mother and son. few even thought that the country had been freed from the yoke of the congress rule   congress mukt  was a term that was not in vogue then .dynasty revived by arch foesif the  peoples  revolution   as the janata party s victory in      was described by some  had not collapsed within the next three years  the  dynasty  would have ended then and there. but the  dynasty  was revived by its arch foes.also read  why the congress party should stop apologising about dynastycharan singh challenged the morarji desai government and toppled it in     . he took indira gandhi s support and became prime minister. the deal between indira and charan singh was struck by sanjay. later  indira gandhi withdrew her outside support to the charan singh government and it collapsed.the      lok sabha election brought indira gandhi back to power.it was indira gandhi s assassination that brought rajiv gandhi into limelight. sonia gandhi was fiercely opposed to rajiv taking over as the pm  my years with indira gandhi by p.c. alexander . if sonia was keen to continue the  dynasty   she would not have opposed rajiv gandhi becoming the pm.it is amusing that neither varun gandhi nor his mother maneka gandhi is ever accused of carrying forward the dynasty.they find prominence in the bjp essentially because they are members of the nehru gandhi family. if instead of sonia gandhi  the family baton was passed on to maneka  then would it not have been described as dynastic succession recognition for dynastyafter rajiv gandhi s assassination in may       there was no nehru gandhi member at the top of the congress for nearly seven years. almost immediately after rajiv s assassination  the entire congress working committee had unanimously decided to make sonia gandhi the party president. she politely but firmly refused.it was after the defeat of the narasimha rao government in      and the collapse of three successive governments  vajpayee s    day government followed by deve gowda and i.k. gujral s short stints as prime ministers  that sonia decided to join active politics in december     .if in those seven years  the stars in the congress  like sharad pawar  madhavrao scindia and digvijaya singh  had established their leadership within the party  sonia gandhi would not have joined  or they would not have felt it necessary to request her to come and take charge of the party. so again  the  dynasty  did not impose itself on the party  but was urged by the top leadership to rescue the party from further decline.also read  the political dynasty nobody is talking about  sardar patel ssonia gandhi had failed to lead her party to success in      and      elections. she was labelled a failure. the opposition and the media condemned and ridiculed her for her accent  for being a foreigner and for not understanding a complex country like india.  the same commentators later called her sagacious  confident and even statesman like .the congress could have dumped her as sharad pawar indeed tried in       by splitting the party on the question of her foreign origin and creating a new outfit  the nationalist congress party  ncp . but pawar s breakaway group could not inspire confidence and except for a few  most congress leaders remained with the sonia gandhi led party.in sonia gandhi s nearly two decade long tenure as congress president  the  dynasty  tag became a stigma. although there was criticism against sanjay gandhi in the     s and rajiv gandhi in the     s  dynasty was either accepted as part and parcel of realpolitik or tolerated because  there was no alternative .in       when the bjp thought that sonia gandhi would become the prime minister  all hell broke loose   sushma swaraj threatened to shave her head in protest while uma bharti said it  will be the darkest day in the history  of india if sonia became the pm.sonia s refusal to become the pm made her a living legend and later the one wielding the  remote control  of the manmohan singh government. the alleged indirect  dynastic control  was condemned  but the political class also took it in its stride. all parties  including the bjp  always looked up to sonia  even when manmohan singh was the prime minister. it was a kind of recognition for the  dynasty .revival   survivalthe term  dynasty   however  became an expression of virulent abuse and disgust only after rahul gandhi took to the political stage. for the last    years  rahul has been the target of the opposition and the media. he has been viciously ridiculed and derided as unintelligent. he has been widely abused on the social media. prime minister narendra modi almost took a wicked pleasure  like a bully in school  in running down the persona of rahul gandhi. perhaps  no other person has suffered the kind of humiliation that rahul has.and yet  from akhilesh yadav to uddhav thackeray  from m.k. stalin and kanimozhi to y.s. jagan mohan reddy  sukhbir singh badal and omar abdullah  everyone is party of dynastic politics. but the national condemnation and barbs are reserved only for the gandhis.also read  smriti irani s makeover  from being most disliked modi minister to dynasty slayer in amethithe indian national congress is currently in dire straits  but still enjoys a vast following among people and has a legacy of over     years. it can revive itself and survive with or without the nehru gandhi dynasty. if the congress could march ahead after nehru s death and indira and rajiv gandhi s assassination  falling and rising again  why can t it do the same after rahul gandhi s resignation but rahul has made it amply clear that he is not retiring from politics  to oblige lord meghnad desai  nor running away from the mission he has

ambedkar knew about cartoons trolling him and he blamed  congress press  for it
text size  a  a b.r. ambedkar was the subject of many cartoons in his lifetime. but why should they matter to india six decades after the man has died  it is because ambedkar is seen through a very different prism today and the toxic lampooning he was subjected to continues to date for dalit leaders like mayawati.a new book by a young researcher from the department of arts and aesthetics  jnu  compiles these cartoons on ambedkar  which were lying in dusty archives and news clippings  to show not much has changed. unnamati syama sundar  who is a cartoonist and signs off as syam  in his book  no laughing matter  the ambedkar cartoons            took pains to scratch beneath the surface and locate the meaning and biases in these     cartoons.ambedkar himself knew about the casteist and sexist cartoons and chose to respond to them. he criticised the media for being one sided and a  congress press . in       when he was asked to deliver a lecture on the    st birthday of govind ranade  ambedkar said   i know the congress press well. i attach no value to its criticism. it has never refuted my arguments. it knows only  how  to criticise  rebuke and revile me for everything i do  and to misreport  misrepresent and pervert everything i say. nothing that i do pleases the congress press. also read  dragging dead buffalo to wearing sari  how ambedkar was trolled by casteist cartoonistsncert controversysyam s collection of cartoons comes in the backdrop of the      controversy about an ambedkar cartoon in the ncert political science textbook. an mp protested against the cartoon saying it was offensive to ambedkar and dalits. the cartoon  drawn by keshav shankar pillai  showed an impatient nehru standing with a whip behind a snail called  constitution . the snail was being driven by ambedkar. the cartoon was meant to depict nehru s frustration with the pace of the constituent assembly drawing up the constitution.the controversy resulted in the ncert dropping the cartoon from the book and the resignation of yogendra yadav and suhas palshikar from the advisory board. if you are interested to know what yadav thinks about this controversy after seven years  you may like to read his recent article in theprint.also read  columbia university teaches ambedkar s biography  but few in india have even read itwe are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowno laughing matterby digging out     cartoons from different publications and putting them in the context of intersections of history and biography  syam uses discursive methods of encoding and decoding propounded by stuart hall  to find meaning in them. according to hall s theory  the audience derives their own meaning from media texts. these meanings can be dominant  negotiated or oppositional depending on her position in society. syam is able to see  due to his social and cultural location and academic training  what many of us may not see in those cartoons.for many of us  the cartoons on ambedkar can be funny or even benign commentary  but not for the author and may be not so for million others in india.these cartoons come at a significant time when iconography of ambedkar is the trend and many hagiographic accounts are being written about him  and when the government of the day  despite not being comfortable with his ideology  has developed huge structures   panchatirth  five important places in the life of ambedkar  don t miss the usage of the word tirth    dedicated to him. this is also the time when his famous treaties like annihilation of caste and riddles in hinduism have gone missing from the shelves of government publishers.also read  how gandhi made ambedkar a villain in his fight to be the real representative of dalitscartoon to lampoonit is interesting that the first cartoon on ambedkar appeared in       at the time of the debate on communal awards  poona pact and separate electorates. by then ambedkar had accomplished many feats and led many movements. he was in public life since     . in       he started publishing his journal mook nayak. in       he led mahad satyagraha to secure the rights of the dalits to drink water from public tanks. that same year he burnt the manusmriti. two years later  he submitted a memorandum to the simon commission emphasising the political rights of the  low  castes. in       he led the kalaram temple entry movement in nasik. in       he participated in the second round table conference. up until the     s  ambedkar was not a subject of vilification by media or cartoonists. only when he became the head of the constituent assembly and a national face  did these cartoons crop up. that s the art of killing by silencing.in his introduction to the book  syam cautions the reader   in the ambedkar cartoons  he is often the villain  often the smallest man in the frame  often an object of derision. no laughing matter is not another milquetoast commemorative volume. double edged  this book presents to the public the very cartoons that seem unfair to the subject beloved to it  it mocks the very images it dusts up from the archives and presses back into circulation.  in a nutshell  if you love ambedkar  and if you read this book  get ready to be offended and the angry at the same time.to see how cartooning can be a hegemonic act  one can still compile the cartoons on v.p. singh during the mandal commission agitation         or the cartoons on arjun singh  when he introduced the obc quota        in higher educational institutions. you will also see similar traits in the caricatures of mayawati and lalu prasad.if we go by the cartoons in no laughing matter  most of them appeared in the publications that supported the congress.one of the most offensive cartoons in the book  page      appeared in the rss mouthpiece organiser  in which cartoonist ravindra depicts ambedkar as a kidnapper of upper caste woman for championing the hindu code bill. in that cartoon titled  ambedkar rides an ass of a bill   he is shown riding a donkey  holding a woman in an inappropriate manner and taking her towards a ditch. the horror on the face of the lady is drawn as if indian women were opposed to ideas like getting inheritance rights or doing away with bigamy and polygamy  or having the right to divorce.also read  you can be a hindu nationalist and an ambedkarite bothambedkar knewambedkar was well aware of how the media portrayed him.citing the possible reasons for the hostile attitude of the press towards him  ambedkar said   this animosity of the congress press towards me can to my mind  not unfairly  be explained as a reflex of the hatred of the hindus for the untouchables however strong and however filthy be the abuses which the congress press chooses to shower on me  i must do my duty. i am no worshipper of idols. i believe in breaking them. this is why ambedkar always tried to have his own publications like mook nayak  the leader of the voiceless   bahiskrit bharat  the excluded india   samata  equality   janata  people  and prabuddh bharat  enlightened india . however  due to paucity of funds  most of these publications died early. the publications were no match for the mainstream  big business owned press with bigger circulation.like ambedkar said   with the press in hand  it is easy to manufacture great men. however  syam s book goes a long way to show that the media and cartoonists do not only make great men  but sometimes villains too. it is altogether another matter that their one time villain has now become the subject of hagiography even by his detractors.the

indian tv channels still in election mode  covering every modi move   taunting rahul gandhi
text size  a  a it is both reassuring and disheartening to know that governments may come and go  but television news remains the same  perhaps  forever.think  firstly  of tv reporting  at the best of times  it is as thin as the air and as hazy as a polluted sky over delhi   the headquarters of most news channels   which might explain the haziness of their reporting.wednesday afternoon  the headlines announced   jaitley opts out of govt   ndtv      . ndtv s anchor said this was because of his  deteriorating health    now  who said anything about  deteriorating health   not jaitley. in his letter to prime minister narendra modi excusing him from the next union cabinet  jaitley said doctors had enabled him to  emerge  from most of the challenges he had faced.an ndtv reporter then analysed arun jaitley s possible replacements at the finance ministry. after naming names  amit shah  piyush goyal   the reporter added that these  guesses  would continue into thursday   are we any the wiser after listening to him switch to india today  where the anchor wondered if any  worthy  replacements existed in the bjp for jaitley as fm   she even debated this with bjp s shaina nc  who said there were many worthies. right. meanwhile  piyush goyal  erstwhile finance minister in jaitley s absence  and whoever is jaitley s successor will not be amused.also read  talent deficit biggest

was modinama before  it is modiyatra after  as television news plays follow the leader wherever he goes   or whatever he does. this is not to suggest that pm modi s travels  or actions  are not news   but that tv news ought to go beyond shadowing him.instead  it has abdicated any obligation to reporting news in favour of live coverage of the pm s daily itinerary.from the cave in kedarnath to the bjp headquarters in new delhi thursday  and the nda meet in parliament house saturday to ahmedabad on sunday and varanasi on monday  the prime minister has led the media a merry dance from east to west.monday  for example  tv news channels followed his cavalcade through the streets of varanasi to the kashi temple for the puja  with close ups of the rituals  to his speech   and that of amit shah   later in the day.this total dominance of the airwaves is an art modi has perfected over the last five years  he creates spectacles out of thin air  photo ops where none exist  and possesses the knack of making the right moves in public   all the while ensuring the media remains focused on him.also read  on tv  arnab goswami  rajdeep sardesai   navika kumar looked like they had won      pollsso  we watch him visit his mother  and watch him visit former president pranab mukherjee   or bend to touch the feet of murli manohar joshi  then we watch him receive blessings at kashi and deliver stirring speeches everywhere. all of this constructs the aura of a strong leader who is also a man of faith and humility.in the other corner is the congress president. he was last seen and heard on tv news a week ago  when he conceded defeat to the bjp. since then  there has been the unedifying spectacle of suvs driving in and out of his delhi residence as the  will he won t he  riddle over his resignation allows. but no sight or sound of him   except while paying tribute to jawaharlal nehru on his death anniversary at shantivan monday.tv news taunts him with headlines like   rahul rewarded for rout  authorised to overhaul party   times now    official reward for rahul  total control of cong   republic tv .or presents a confusing picture   rahul adamant he will resign   along with  won t resign for now   ndtv      .television news hounds the congress president  and some in it even bay for his blood  or at the very least  his resignation. on times now and republic tv  anchors like navika kumar  rahul shivshankar  arnab goswami openly insult him  they accuse him of  sulking   throwing a  tantrum   and behaving like a  spoilt child   goswami s contribution .and  instead of boarding the first flight to amethi   especially after the murder of a bjp worker   to meet those who had earlier voted for him  and taken the second flight to wayanad to thank those who

with narendra modi couldn t be more stark.while the pm is already working the public  and the media  to his advantage for the future  the congress is in total  disarray   newsx .not that tv news is complaining  it loves a loser like rahul gandhi   he makes for good tv. and seeing how channels like republic tv and times now  the two that ridicule him the most  flourish in the viewership ratings  viewers apparently love him   and these channels  unrelenting attacks on him   too.those of us weary of the drama can turn elsewhere for relief. never has the sight of bat bashing ball  or ball

why priyanka gandhi vadra should be the next president of the congress party
text size  a  a just as one cannot imagine the bhartiya janata party without the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh  one cannot imagine the congress without the gandhi family. when the bjp is in crisis  the rss steps in to save the day. if the gandhi family steps aside  the congress party may collapse altogether.the demise of the congress party would be fruitful only if another pan india force is ready to replace it. that is currently not happening.rahul gandhi continuing as congress president is not an option. his position is untenable after severe defeats in two successive lok sabha elections. if rahul gandhi continues as party president  it will be more of the same.rahul gandhi has become the picture of incompetence and failure. whether or not this picture is fair to him  it s coming in the way of the party s chances of any rejuvenation. what the congress needs to realise is this   it needs fresh leadership at the top.if rahul gandhi takes back his decision to resign  the whole affair will seem to have been an orchestrated drama. already  reports suggest his proposal to resign is not out of any sense of responsibility or renunciation. he wants to do so in a fit of rage  because he blames the party s top leadership of not following instructions  fighting among each other all the time  and not working with discipline. one report has suggested that he lashed out at leaders who put their sons  interests above the party s   not realising that the same could be said of sonia gandhi.also read  shashi tharoor  obituaries for congress premature. here are   ways to correct its coursethe worst possible outcome of this crisis would be the appointment of a non gandhi in the role of party president  and the congress still being run by the gandhi family. this would be akin to the manmohan sonia model  where the gandhi family enjoyed power without accountability. the gandhi family will make itself immune to criticism  as the party keeps floundering. disgruntled with the new president  party leaders would start running to the gandhi family  thus creating two competing power centres. the congress  eventually  would fall between two stools just like the upa   government did.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nownotably  the gandhi family is not going anywhere even if a non gandhi becomes party president. this would only serve to devalue the post of congress president  as rahul gandhi will continue to have a profile bigger than the party president. he s not proposing to quit politics  neither is his mother or sister.if a non gandhi is not an option  and rahul gandhi is not the option  that leaves us with sonia gandhi and priyanka gandhi vadra. sonia gandhi  as the upa chairperson  has had her time  and now needs to bring about a generational transition in the party. that transition is clearly not an easy task. the last five years saw not rahul gandhi rebuilding the congress but the congress party helping build the image of rahul gandhi  without much success.division of labourbefore solving the problem  we need to identify what the problem is. there are two different problems with the congress today. that the congress party came up with its election campaign and slogan just a few days before polling began  exemplifies how poorly the party is run. secondly  rahul gandhi as the party s public face is a liability. prime minister narendra modi made the      lok sabha election a presidential contest with rahul gandhi  kaamdaar versus naamdaar   which only helped him increase upon the bjp s tally of     seats in      elections to     seats this time.also read  rahul s left leaning aides helped modi brand congress  deshdrohi   blogs party media headmodi has always needed amit shah  the president of bjp  and sonia gandhi ran the congress through ahmed patel. rahul gandhi has tried to do both jobs   being the public face and running the party   besides of course his quarterly holidays. not even modi and sonia have tried to keep everything to themselves.no matter what formula is devised to break the impasse  it is clear that the result will be a division of labour. rahul gandhi will continue to be the public face of the party  trying to build his brand and getting pilloried by the bjp on a daily basis.least bad optionyet  at the very least  the party organisation deserves another person s attention. this could only be priyanka gandhi vadra  because only a gandhi can have orders followed in the congress party  if that. only a gandhi could be the unifier for the congress party.this is not to say that priyanka gandhi vadra has covered herself with glory in her debut as a mass politician this election. she hardly built her brand  making herself all about her brother. she made mistakes like a political novice  such as speculating she might take on modi in varanasi  and then appearing to chicken out. she didn t turn out to be a great orator people expected her to be.also read  congress should avoid knee jerk reactions  milind deora on rahul gandhi s offer to resignyet  by virtue of being a gandhi  she s the least bad option. a sachin pilot might do a better job than her perhaps  but will ashok gehlot listen to him  a mallikarjun kharge might appear more qualified for the job with his experience  but will anybody believe he is anything more than a rubber stamp of the first family not that replacing party president will change the party s fortunes overnight. in the end  the congress party needs to regain its ability to connect with the masses. it needs to reach out to the people  listen to them  become their voice  solve their problems  occupy the opposition space. doesn t look like the congress party of today  under rahul gandhi  knows how to do that.views are personal.subscribe to our

the manmohan sonia model  where the gandhi family enjoyed power without accountability. the gandhi family will make itself immune to criticism  as the party keeps floundering. disgruntled with the new president  party leaders would start running to the gandhi family  thus creating two competing power centres. the congress  eventually  would fall between two stools just like the upa   government

the option  that leaves us with sonia gandhi and priyanka gandhi vadra. sonia gandhi  as the upa chairperson  has had her time  and now needs to bring about a generational transition in the party. that transition is clearly not an easy task. the last five years saw not rahul gandhi rebuilding the congress but the congress party helping build the image of rahul gandhi  without much success.division of labourbefore solving the problem  we need to identify what the problem is. there are two different problems with the congress today. that the congress party came up with its election campaign and slogan just a few days before polling began  exemplifies how poorly the party is run. secondly  rahul gandhi as the party s public face is a liability. prime minister narendra modi made the      lok sabha election a presidential contest with rahul gandhi  kaamdaar versus naamdaar   which only helped him increase upon the bjp s tally of     seats in      elections to     seats this time.also read  rahul s left leaning aides helped modi brand congress  deshdrohi   blogs party media headmodi has always needed amit shah  the president of bjp  and sonia gandhi ran the congress through ahmed patel. rahul gandhi has tried to do both jobs   being the public face and running the party   besides of course his quarterly holidays. not even modi and sonia have tried to keep everything to themselves.no matter what formula is devised to break the impasse  it is clear that the result will be a division of labour. rahul gandhi will continue to be the public face of the party  trying to build his brand and getting pilloried by the bjp on a daily basis.least bad optionyet  at the very least  the party organisation deserves another person s attention. this could only be priyanka gandhi vadra  because only a gandhi can have orders followed in the congress party  if that. only a gandhi could be the unifier for the congress party.this is not to say that priyanka gandhi vadra has covered herself with glory in her debut as a mass politician this election. she hardly built her brand  making herself all about her brother. she made mistakes like a political novice  such as speculating she might take on modi in varanasi  and then appearing to chicken out. she didn t turn out to be a great orator people expected her to be.also read  congress should avoid knee

party president will change the party s fortunes overnight. in the end  the congress party needs to regain its ability to connect with the masses. it needs to reach out to the people  listen to them  become their voice  solve their problems  occupy the opposition space. doesn t look like the congress party of today  under rahul gandhi  knows how to do that.views are personal.subscribe to our

shashi tharoor  obituaries for congress premature. here are   ways to correct its course
text size  a  a the editor s request for a piece discussing the way forward for the congress party puts me in something of a quandary. i am conscious that  as a freshly elected third term mp  i am hardly a veteran in the party. i am not a member of the congress working committee  nor of any of its decision making bodies. but as an elected representative of the congress  i am dismayed by so many premature obituaries for my party.let it be said up front  reports of our demise are greatly exaggerated. the congress is very much alive and well and retains a significant hold on the affections of the public. that we obtained just under    per cent of the national vote hardly makes us an irrelevance in a divided and competitive polity. we are in power in four states  five with karnataka  and retain a pan national presence second to none. yet  to be reduced to    seats in the lok sabha is sobering and points to the need for a course correction. what might that consist of  here are nine suggestions embracing both policy and practice  . decide what we stand for and communicate it effectively and repeatedly.the congress  core message has been the values it has embodied since the freedom struggle   in particular inclusive growth  social justice  communal harmony  abolition of poverty and the protection of the marginalised  including minorities  women  dalits and adivasis. these have been distorted and portrayed as pandering to vote banks rather than as the genuine  indeed visceral  convictions they are. we are the political embodiment of india s pluralism and have been a strong and committed voice for the preservation of secularism as its fundamental reflection. we need to reaffirm our belief in these values and keep reiterating them at every opportunity.we made a beginning in recent years with our top leaders eschewing their habitual reticence and speaking out more often  more spontaneously and more loudly  including on social media. doing so consistently would set an example of accessibility and transparency about our values  our actions  our motives and concerns. if we share our thinking with the people  we will find it easier to bring them to our side. the media driven mass politics of the   st century requires open communication  which the congress in the not so distant past had shied away from. that must change for good.also read  congress underestimated modi  cult   nyay was announced too late  shashi tharoor . start the revival of the congress in the states.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowwe have received a major setback in the lok sabha  but there is no time to lick our wounds  there are three important state elections looming just four months from now  in maharashtra  haryana and jharkhand. before may we would have fancied our chances in all three  and there is no cause for despair. the fact is that many voters said they were voting for modi  not for his party s candidate. that option is not on the ballot in the state elections. let us test the effectiveness of our local messaging and our ability to exploit anti incumbency in these states. and where we are in power  start implementing some of the excellent ideas in the      congress manifesto  to the extent that it is possible to do so without power in the centre. . explore pragmatic coalitions so as to strengthen the anti government space.it is time to construct a coalition of regional parties in the lok sabha to join us in the visible and audible task of opposition to the bjp government. we are the largest national opposition party and must reach out to embrace them in our common efforts to resist unacceptable bjp policies. political arrangements and adjustments will also permit us to put up a stronger fight both in parliament and in state assembly elections. we have understandably been concerned not to let our own local party structures in some states atrophy as a result of such arrangements. with the larger interest in view  we must put aside our ambitions in those states where we have not been in power for a quarter century or more   especially up  bihar  west bengal and tamil nadu   and work with the regional parties who are strong in such states. . wield leverage on the central government through the issue of centre state relations.this is an issue on which we can make common cause with regional parties. non bjp parties currently control    state governments and have a political interest in resisting an overweening centre. at the same time  we must use our performance in state governments to demonstrate that we are the natural party of governance   the very status that the bjp is seeking to usurp. this will mean sending some of our national stalwarts back to their states to strengthen the party there  rather than congregating in delhi where they are less needed in the new dispensation.also read  nehru gandhi family nostalgia is just not enough to win elections in india anymore . do not allow the bjp to monopolise the nationalist narrative.as the party that brought freedom to india and valiantly preserved it for decades  and therefore has critical experience in safeguarding india s national interests  the congress must proudly articulate its own nationalism and remain vigilant on security and foreign policy issues that could be mishandled by the bjp government. though our tradition is that political differences stop at the water s edge and that foreign policy is india s  not any one party s  we must not allow the bjp to use its governmental position to be identified as the sole protector of indian national pride  which we may define very differently. . be a constructive opposition inside and outside parliament.being constructive does not imply meek surrender to the bjp majority. but knee jerk opposition for the sake of opposing  the style adopted by the bjp during upa rule  will put us out of sync with the mandate given again by the people of india to narendra modi and invite public rejection. there is a broad sentiment in the country saying  the congress have ruled for so long  why won t they give him a chance   especially in the initial phase of his second term  it is in our interest to co operate whenever the government lives up to modi s conciliatory pronouncements and truly governs for the benefit of all indians  but to oppose him robustly whenever he pursues a sectarian or divisive agenda. . devote most of the party s attention to the grassroots.the congress is rightly accused of having lost touch with the grassroots in many states. we must focus more on panchayat and local government elections  and pay more attention to the petty problems of governance and corruption that beleaguer most indians and which voters blamed us for when they occurred under our rule. democracy is not just about elections every five years  but also about what happens to the daily lives of ordinary citizens between elections. we have to return to the ethos of politics as social work for those who cannot help themselves.also read  harsh criticism of rahul gandhi unjustified because congress slide began in      . promote inner party democracy and rein in internal dissent.rahul gandhi has been consistently right on this. open up the party to internal elections for its key positions  including membership of the cwc. allow  indeed encourage  the emergence of local  state and regional leaders  ratified by periodic votes of party members. at the same time  crack down severely on the disloyalty and dissidence stoked by those who put their personal ambitions above the party s interests  a habit visible in many places during the recent elections. when such behaviour occurs against elected leaders  it is easier to discredit than when it is conducted against those who can be portrayed as unelected courtiers. . articulate a vision for the future that embraces the aspirations of india s majority   the young.a startling    per cent of voters this year were under   . they need to hear what we can do for them  especially in areas where the modi government has so far failed them  like education  skill development  and job creation. we need to implement policies in these areas in the states we rule and then advocate them at the centre. young indians must believe we understand their aspirations and can be trusted to promote them in government.these suggestions are by no means an exhaustive list. but in my view  they offer some pointers to the way forward for india s oldest  most inclusive and most experienced party to restore its past glory.the author is a member of parliament for thiruvananthapuram and former mos for external affairs and hrd. he served the un as an administrator and peacekeeper for three decades. he

harsh criticism of rahul gandhi unjustified because congress slide began in     
text size  a  a after the      lok sabha election results  the bharatiya janata party has achieved a status that only the congress has enjoyed so far   of being india s single dominant party. but the bjp s rise and the congress  slide didn t start with the      election  which brought narendra modi to power. it began in       when the bjp and the congress swapped their ability to convert success in assembly elections into seats in lok sabha  called the spillover effect.the analysis of the spillover effect confirms that india has the tendency to be dominated by only one political party  and that it never really became used to a truly bipolar election.winning assembly  losing lok sabhathe congress could not turn its six month old success in madhya pradesh  chhattisgarh and rajasthan into lok sabha wins. the party won only   of the total    lok sabha seats in the three states.this inability has been attributed to infighting  the failure of the party s campaign to resonate with voters  its weak organisational strength at the grassroots  and  of course  the modi factor. while all these factors did contribute to the party s poor performance in the three heartland states  it was still surprising that voter sentiment turned against the congress within a span of six months.also read  wins in state polls do have a bearing on lok sabha elections  if held within   years  studyfigure   clearly demonstrates the complete inability of the congress to capitalise on the gains made in december      elections in madhya pradesh and rajasthan. each data point in the graph below represents the vote share of the congress in an assembly segment in the      state elections and its vote share in the lok sabha constituency encompassing that assembly segment in the      lok sabha election.figure          trend in madhya pradeshwe are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for

share for the congress in the larger lok sabha seat within which the assembly segment is located. an upward sloping line suggests a spillover  or that the congress did marginally better in the      election in terms of vote share due to its success in the      assembly elections. the more votes it received in an assembly segment  the greater the number of votes it receives in the subsequent lok sabha election. the spillover effect for the congress was  however  so mild that it did not translate into any gains in terms of seats.also read  modi era begins in politics as caste factor fades. here s why he won t be easy to beatslide in the making since     so  what happened  many claim that incidents in the brief six months between the assembly elections and the lok sabha election completely changed the tide of this spillover effect. though additional factors  such as balakot  undoubtedly had a minor effect  this decline in spillover effect for the congress has in fact been a long time coming. if we plot the same graphs as above but aggregate across many election cycles  we can visibly see the difference in the congress  slope pre  and post     .figure     pre      congress trendfigure     post      congress trendthe degree of the spillover effect for the congress had already declined to the black solid line in figure   even without incorporating the      lok sabha results. this suggests that the spillover effect for the congress had been decreasing over the past two decades and is not a recent phenomenon. after incorporating the      results  the slope declines even further. what happened in      was just a natural progression of decreasing inability of the congress to translate its success in assembly elections into subsequent lok sabha elections.also read  congress  death wish could leave    crore indians in limbothis really low upward trending slope for the congress shows that the results of the      lok sabha election in the three hindi heartland states  though intuitively surprising  are not shocking when considered in the context of the electoral history of india since     . harsh criticism of the congress leadership in these states might not be entirely justified as the leaders are just victims of the congress  decreasing ability to hold onto successful assembly election results. rahul gandhi took over a largely sinking ship when he became the congress  president in december     . his party s assembly election victories should not be used as predictors of national election victories anymore even within the very states that the congress won those assembly elections.reversal in bjp s fortunesthe inverse is being seen for the bjp where it is reaping the benefits of increased spillover effects from assembly elections. in all the assembly segments that the bjp won in       it did better in the encompassing lok sabha seat in      by an even higher margin. the bjp s success at an assembly level can be used as a strong predictor of its success at a national level. this also shows the extent to which the bjp has emerged as a national party that it is facing spillover effects similar to the degree which the congress used to before     .whether india s tendency to remain dominated by any one political party at a given time is essential for streamlined policy making or detrimental to an inclusive

how rahul gandhi could have defeated narendra modi
text size  a  a there are no certainties in politics. narendra modi and amit shah were defeated in delhi and bihar in     . they couldn t capture power in karnataka despite being the single largest party in     . they embarrassingly lost many by polls they should have won easily. just a few months before the lok sabha elections  they lost some key stronghold states in the hindi heartland.they could have lost the      lok sabha election too  if only they had a smarter opponent. it is clear that the mantle was on rahul gandhi  as modi made the election mercilessly presidential. if people wanted rahul gandhi as prime minister  it would have lifted the fortunes of regional parties too  with the prospect of a upa  .also read     reasons why modi shah s bjp got the better of congress   everyone elsehere are four key mistakes rahul gandhi made. . positive campaigningthe big picture of rahul gandhi s campaign was negative the slogan we heard the most was  chowkidar chor hai . compare this to modi s campaign as opposition leader in        . it was about promising  achhe din   about making things happen  solving problems  showing people big dreams.voters want to know from opposition leaders what they would do in power  how they would do it  and how they would be better at solving the people s problems.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowthere were enough problems  the failure of demonetisation  the slowdown in economic growth after gst  the suffering of farmers due to low returns and rising unemployment. but rahul gandhi failed to make himself the answer to these problems. at best  he highlighted the problems  and even that was done so poorly that it didn t make people turn.if rahul gandhi had spent five years coming across as a problem solver rather than just a critic of modi s policies  people wouldn t have been asking who s the alternative.also read       will be known as the  aayega to modi hi  election . building trusttravelling in this election i asked people why they weren t voting for the congress despite the promise of rs        a year per family. the answer invariably was lack of trust. they didn t believe it was possible. congress workers told me that wherever they went telling people about the nyay scheme  they were asked where the money would come from  and they themselves didn t know the answer.if implemented  the nyay proposal would completely end poverty in india. the congress estimated the scheme would affect    crore people. whether or not the proposal was sound economics  it should have been made the poor flock to the congress over night.the proposal was announced too late in the day just a few days before the first phase of polling. considering the congress is weak in resources  and is generally poor at communicating with the masses  it should have announced the scheme much earlier. it is true that hardly anyone heard of the slogan  ab ho ga nyay  but many had heard of rs       . they just didn t trust rahul gandhi to deliver it.modi made so many tall promises in      that the congress had labelled him  feku . yet  people voted for modi s tall promises in      because he sold them trust  i ve done it in gujarat  he said  calling it a model he would replicate for the entire country.people voted for modi despite rising unemployment because they thought  on balance  that modi was more likely to be able to create jobs than rahul gandhi. bjp voting unemployed youth in bihar told a reporter as much.rahul gandhi could have built public trust in his leadership by contributing  or publicly appearing to contribute  fresh ideas in congress ruled states like punjab. he could have sold trust by explaining  how  he plans to solve problems. this could have made modi look a less credible leader by contrast  as he struggled to show the results of his      promises.also read  rahul gandhi s nyay raises too many questions   is not the answer to ending poverty . responding to public moodin a democracy  the role of the opposition is to become the voice of the people. politicians design their election campaigns after gauging public mood.the lokpal movement was wildly successful in      because public mood was against corruption. it forced the upa   to enact a lokpal bill. for five years pm narendra modi made excuses to not appoint a lokpal and nobody cared because people didn t see corruption as the top issue anymore. people tend to worry more about corruption when inflation shoots up.arvind kejriwal did not go from being an ngo activist to delhi chief minister because of the lokpal movement. to defeat both the bjp and the congress in delhi and emerge victorious  aap leaders told me  the party carried out a survey to understand the biggest issue for the people of delhi. it was rising and inflated electricity bills. he made electricity his central campaign and won handsomely. similarly  the modi campaign in      focused separately with separate slogans for all the top issues people worried about  such as inflation  black money and women s safety.in      these issues were missing  as the top concern was jobs. yashwant deshmukh of c voter tells me that in his tracker surveys  employment had started showing up as a rising concern in mid       even before demonetisation. instead of making jobs his central campaign  rahul gandhi went after corruption. by doing so  he was attacking modi on his strong point  corruption free image   letting him off on his weak point  unemployment .it would have been easy for rahul gandhi to tell people that demonetisation and gst were behind job losses   as the cpi m  did in coimbatore and defeated the bjp there. instead  rahul gandhi made rafale the central pitch.also read  why it makes sense for rahul gandhi   congress to persist with rafale as      campaign issue . permanent campaigningwhen rahul gandhi hugged narendra modi in parliament last year  he won the day. rahul has been building the abstract binary of love and hate for some time. with a visual to portray this binary  rahul had finally managed to convey the point. it was during a no confidence motion that the opposition was losing. with one gimmick  rahul gandhi turned a loss into a victory. he should have launched a whole gandhigiri campaign  asking congress leaders to give hugs or send flowers to bjp rss leaders across the country  especially when they made sectarian or controversial remarks.rahul gandhi s supporters rightly complain that the media has mostly become a modi propaganda arm. but even the pro modi media was unable to ignore rahul s hug.he needed to do a lot more things that pro modi media could not afford to ignore. he needed to produce visuals to overshadow the narendra modi image factory   visuals that communicated his ideas. instead  when he went for the mansarovar yatra he produced clumsy images looking like a happy tourist rather than a hindu pilgrim. he also takes frequent foreign holidays and even when he s in india  he  disappears  from media limelight for days on end. modi  by contrast  makes sure you see him doing something or the other every day as part of his permanent campaign strategy.to impress upon people that he was worried about unemployment and farmers  distress and the falling revenues of small businesses  rahul gandhi should have come up with ways to communicate through images  symbols  and media gimmicks that can t be ignored like a dead cat on the table.views are personal.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis   only you can fix it you are reading this

in the next five years  modi will need to fulfil promises without blaming congress
text size  a  a most indian journalists are more obsessed with the unseen near future than with the immediate present. during election season  this obsession reaches its peak. it starts with poll predictions and the electoral prospects of parties in the lok sabha elections. now that the results are out  bringing narendra modi led nda to power again with a massive mandate  journalists are busy predicting the induction  and removal  of ministers and their portfolios.i have been a participant and addict of the media s  game of thrones  for over    years. like alcoholics anonymous  i often feel there should be a  mediaholics anonymous .many journalists and commentators have now begun to see beyond     . there are eyeing the      lok sabha elections and wondering what the political scene will be. in the next five years  modi and his ministers will have a lot to do  and no failure can be blamed on the congress anymore.also read  modi era begins in politics as caste factor fades. here s why he won t be easy to beatwho will be the political actors by       narendra modi will be     and according to his own diktat on age limit  he will have to retire soon after that. manmohan singh s rajya sabha term comes to an end next month. lal krishna advani will be   . sonia gandhi will be   . sharad pawar will be   . most leaders of most parties will be in the departure zone.even today

alarmed the sangh. therefore  the relationship between the rss and modi shah will also affect the internal management of the party and administration by     .apart from the personalities and the sangh  there are other urgent issues that could lead to a navigational crisis for the bjp. the economy is already in doldrums  notwithstanding the bravado and clever obfuscations of arun jaitley.all of bjp s well wishers are expecting reforms  which have not been carried out in the first term. a large section of the corporate class is also waiting for special concessions. by and large  they are not happy with the semi socialist welfarist povertarian policies of the nda government. but they also understood that the bjp needed populist tactics to come back to power.also read  modi s key test with trump will be to ensure make in india doesn t clash with make in americathe liberal commentators had condemned the national advisory committee chaired by sonia gandhi for its  pro poor  schemes  including mgnrega  which was ridiculed most by narendra modi himself . these very schemes were incorporated by the nda government and advertised by them in election campaigns. the same critics of the nac  who are exceptionally considerate to modi  had not shown similar sympathy for manmohan singh.but declining domestic investment  slow or reluctant foreign direct investments  exports coming down and  of course  the farmer distress coupled with vast unemployment  mainly in the rural areas  are staring the bjp in the face. this time  modi cannot run away from them by blaming the nehru gandhi dynasty   from motilal to rahul  via jawaharlal  indira and  bhrashtachari  rajiv.the argument that he is carrying the burden of the last    years will neither impress the unemployed youth nor the aspirational middle classes. the bjp and their trolling armies were always slanderous and abusive towards the so called intellectuals  without realising that the modi government lacks the talent to tackle real issues. this scarcity of talent in administration and party has often made the bjp leadership  and modi personally  a laughing stock   especially on whatsapp groups.the modi government has given a  follow on  to the opposition. it is unlikely that the opposition can match the nda score in this inning. so  modi cannot make rahul gandhi a target for his failures and divert issues. he will have to face them himself. he has built his image as an  invincible emperor   with his massive media management. now modi  as well as embedded tv anchors  will have to prove that the emperor s new

one in three people at congress rallies may not have voted for the party  lokniti csds
text size  a  a after the bjp s massive win in the      lok sabha elections  it s time to analyse what went wrong for the congress  which had launched its long awaited brahmastra  priyanka gandhi vadra  just a few months before the elections to take on the unstoppable narendra modi led bjp in uttar pradesh  the state that dictates how the rest of the hindi heartland votes.leading from the front  the congress  newly elected general secretary and in charge of eastern uttar pradesh  priyanka gandhi vadra began her campaign with a roadshow in lucknow. her campaign then moved to include hundreds of public meetings  rallies and roadshows  including the innovative  boat yatra   across the state. all of priyanka gandhi s rallies and roadshows saw a sizeable crowd turn up  helping create a buzz that the congress  brahmastra had boosted its chances to regain the congress  lost ground in uttar pradesh and in the rest of india.on    may  here s what happened  the congress  trifling vote share of  .  per cent in uttar pradesh in the      lok sabha elections had further dipped to  .  per cent in     . congress president rahul gandhi lost amethi by more than        votes  and although upa chairperson sonia gandhi retained rai bareily  her victory margin had come down from    per cent in      to    per cent in     .the results show a sharp contrast between the crowds at rallies and the final vote share. it thus becomes important to empirically analyse whether the crowd at election rallies turn into votes  and if not then who are these people who show up to listen to the political leaders.also read       elections ended  dynasties  only of congress  bjp s are well and truly thrivingelection rallies are not a new phenomenon but what has changed with time are the methodologies  styles and the modes of communication used by the political parties. the lok sabha      elections saw them organising padyatras  foot march   jan sabhas  public meetings   mohalla sabhas  roadshows and other such events to attract voters. social media was extensively used to connect with the masses and inform them about the location and schedule of these rallies. some of the biggest rallies and roadshows of prominent leaders made it to the front pages of all major national newspapers besides dominating ad space on tv news channels.the size of crowd at an election rally  roadshow or padyatra are generally regarded as a measure to gauge the popularity of the political party and its leader  and where they stand in the electoral race. it is generally assumed that the people who attend the rallies are also going to vote for the same party. lokniti csds studied a few rallies from the      election campaign. we randomly chose two rallies  one each of narendra modi and rahul gandhi  both in western uttar pradesh  and two roadshows  one each of congress and aam aadmi party in delhi .we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and

it was the first rally that they had ever attended. the survey also suggests that compared to the congress  the bjp and the aap relied more on technology  with one in every four respondents who turned up for the bjp s rally and one in every three who attended the aap s roadshow did so in response to the message received on phone or social media. as it happened  the bjp was by far more organised than the congress as a little less than half of the respondents had the information about the rally a week or two before  on the other hand  only about one fourth at the congress  rally knew about it well in advance.also read  three things indian liberals held dear were tested this lok sabha electionare the crowds brought to the rallies or do they come on their own  the dozens of private buses outside the bjp s rally in western uttar pradesh suggest this could be one of the foremost reasons that the party had    per cent people travelling more than    kms to attend the rally  while the congress had only    per cent people travelling from that far. moreover     per cent of the respondents in western up rallies believe that the majority of the people had not come on their own but were called or brought to the rally by the party. in the congress  rally  this number was as high as    per cent. it implies that one in every three people present in the congress rally might not have even voted for the party.to find out if their loyalty is more towards the party or its leaders  we asked the respondents if they had come to attend the rally for the party or to see or listen to the leader. in western up  the loyalty of congress supporters was found to be more towards the party with    per cent coming only for the party and    per cent for the leader. this gap was only   per cent in the bjp s rally  where    per cent had come only for the party and    per cent for their leader.interestingly  we came across a family which had come only to see the helicopters and had taken their seats adjacent to the ground where rahul gandhi and priyanka gandhi s helicopter was to land  but due to bad weather the gandhis could not reach the rally venue.also read  this is what changed for voters from      to      lok sabha elections  nothingdo bigger crowds indicate a strong mandate in the party s favour  we asked respondents if they would also attend rallies or roadshows of other political parties or leaders. nearly one third of the respondents said  yes  or  maybe . comparing the rallies in western up  the numbers were    per cent at the bjp s rally and as high as    per cent in the congress . this larger proportion present in the congress  rally can be classified as floating voters. they are usually undecided about whom to vote for. the bjp s performance in up  where they won    seats  was better than the final tally of the congress in the entire country. thus  huge crowds in the rallies might just be deceiving  and don t always turn into votes.sanjay kumar is a

from barmer. deora  who had got the backing of powerful residents of south mumbai for his candidacy   among them mukesh ambani and uday kotak   can only say  india has changed. i can only hope it is for the better .the biggest reverberation of that transformation  from an old feudal idea of entitlement to a new culture of meritocracy  is embodied in the defeat of rahul gandhi from amethi  which

incorruptible  against the  corrupt . the hero and villain of the story has been set. this message has bombarded us through mainstream media and communicated night and day with whatsapp messaging.  the messaging  she adds  has been so strong that even as some of us seek to examine its merit  we do so in exactly the same language that the framework of analysis has been set. if the winner is the hero with raw wisdom  the loser can only be the fool. nuanced takes are time consuming in times when we need not just the soundbite  even that is too long  but either affirmations or negations.she believes rahul gandhi was against extraordinary odds. one  to head a party that had lost its moorings with social movements  which once upon a time constituted the core of the indian national congress. two  to battle against an extraordinarily well crafted image damaging exercise. three  to try   and he did   to bring in larger questions of an inclusive india  of the last woman in the line  of love and compassion. how do you speak this in a noxious environment of a discourse of exterminating termites from their homes  the battle  she adds  is long and hard.  the easiest is to blame it

indira gandhi to modi   india s secular democracy has been dying for a while now
text size  a  a narendra modi s emphatic re election victory makes inevitable something that was long feared  the transformation of india from secular democracy to hindu majoritarian state.far from helping to reverse the global tide of illiberal figures and movements  voters in the world s largest democracy have advanced it. modi won with a landslide despite having failed miserably in his central mission  to create jobs for india s young population.it also did not matter to his supporters that during his first five years in power india s social fabric was systematically shredded and the credibility of virtually every major institution  from the supreme court to india s statistical organizations and the media  was undermined. it seemed more important that modi could claim to have punished pakistan for its support of terrorism with air strikes deep into the country.also read  the bjp strategy that helped narendra modi march past    much will be written about how indians succumbed to a leader with a proven record of economic incompetence  social disunity and xenophobic nationalism. but those who express great shock over this moral and political calamity will be exposing their own intellectual naivete. the fact is that their understanding of democracy  especially its indian variant  has not kept up with reality.the great theorists of democracy  from tom paine to john stuart mill  insisted that democracy expresses the rational choices of its citizens. but india s experience tells us otherwise.fake news  hate speech and corporate money can easily compromise rational choices. the ostensibly benign rule of the majority can quickly degenerate into belligerent majoritarianism. and institutions  however unimpeachable  can be subverted by dedicated ideological cadres of the kind modi commands.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowcertainly  modi has amply clarified that while democracies may choose their rulers  they cannot dictate the sort of power their rulers wield   which may be as despotic and arbitrary as in an authoritarian state.many detractors of donald trump  modi  and other elected demagogues have set great store by democracy s impersonal institutions  and their checks and balances. but such faith was always a form of complacency at best  and blindness at worst.many unexamined platitudes about democracy derive from the cold war. the system obviously seemed ethically sound and politically efficient when compared to the authoritarian dictatorships  often communist  of asia  eastern europe and latin america.surrounded by despotisms  india  in particular  drew much political and moral prestige from its status as a democratic nation state. photographs of destitute indians lining up to vote symbolized their exceptional ability to change their rulers.the rapid rise of authoritarian china in the     s made democratic india look even more virtuous in contrast. in actuality  however  if we regard democracy as a promise of equality and dignity  underpinned by rule of law and impartial institutions  rather than just periodic elections  then democracy in india has been under continuous pressure and periodic assault.devising india s radically democratic constitution in the late     s  the dalit leader b.r. ambedkar was already pointing to a fatal contradiction   that though the principle of one man one vote seemed to confer political equality on indian citizens  it left untouched the grotesque social and economies inequalities of indian society.ambedkar s warning resonates even more after modi s victory   we must remove this contradiction at the earliest possible moment or else those who suffer from inequality will blow up the structure of political democracy. one clear sign of this innate precariousness of indian democracy was the  emergency  in the mid     s. faced with mass agitation against her  prime minister indira gandhi suspended fundamental rights and detained opposition leaders and critics. the media surrendered to her as cravenly as it has to modi.also read  this is what changed for voters from      to      lok sabha elections  nothingconventional accounts of the emergency have a happy ending  mrs. gandhi lost elections in      and indian democracy was vindicated. but her spell of authoritarian rule responded to a fundamental crisis resulting from the unfulfilled promises of indian democracy. with india s cruel inequalities intensifying  as they have in recent years  authoritarianism was always likely to become the rule rather than an exception.it is also worth remembering today that hindu majoritarianism  another expedient of a cynical ruling class  was originally forged by india s avowedly secular rulers. mrs. gandhi and her son rajiv  prime minister from      to       unleashed it in india long before anyone had heard of modi.secular as well as hindu nationalist governments presided from the late     s onwards over a brutal counter insurgency in kashmir  which helped corrode many indian institutions   from the judiciary to the media and the military   while mainstreaming anti muslim sentiment in indian politics and society.modi has undoubtedly accelerated the decay of india s political and civil life. but any honest reckoning with india s election results must begin with this admission  the country s secular democracy was dying well before modi gave it a terminal blow.pankaj mishra is a renowned author. his books include  age of anger  a history of the present    from the ruins of empire  the intellectuals who remade asia   and  temptations of the

how indian voters saw congress   a laid back party with no leadership   agenda
text size  a  a the spectacular return of the bjp led nda has scripted a new chapter in india s political history. for once  most exit polls were right in predicting the election outcome.but then  the      lok sabha results were not difficult to predict. anyone who closely followed the events in the past few months knew which way the winds were blowing.while the bjp came across as a serious player  the congress gave an impression that it was a laid back party with no leadership  no enthusiasm among the cadre and no alternate agenda.the bjp s      victory is driven by a number of factors and strategies   the winners got them right while the losers had none to begin with.also read       will be known as the  aayega to modi hi  electionmuscular policy against terrorismindia saw some major terrorist attacks on military establishments forces in the last few years   pathankot  uri and pulwama. terrorism from across the border was not new  but modi government s response was.it swung into action and carried out cross border surgical strikes in september       weeks after the uri terror attack. this year  in the wake of the terror attack on a crpf convoy in pulwama  the iaf carried out air strikes on balakot in pakistan.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your

defence deal were foolish  to say the least.the congress failed to read the writing on the wall. it was na ve on the part of the congress and rest of the opposition to expect the bjp to desist from claiming credit for taking on terrorism.taking it to the peoplemodi s surgical strike on corruption began with demonetisation  and structural corrections in economy continued with the introduction of gst. the congress and other political adversaries of the bjp misread the public mood and miserably failed to provide an alternative economic policy or a positive narrative on development.the bjp  in contrast  effectively conveyed to people the modi government s welfare programmes and how meticulously they were implemented.also read  rahul gandhi must decide if congress is a european ngo or a party in nationalist indiaa large section of rural women  youth and first time voters  who were looking for a change  found a ready platform in the bjp and modi s leadership. the congress leadership  on the other hand  focused only on non existent corruption charges and ran a political campaign on unsubstantiated accusations.rahul no match for modifor the congress leadership  a mere introspection is meaningless. the party needs a complete overhaul  from top to bottom  preferably from the top. while rahul gandhi s leadership may not be questioned  the party will be wiped out if it fails to change the way it is being run now. a series of failures is too serious a matter to be left only to drawing room debates.it has been proven second time in a row that rahul gandhi is no match for narendra modi in strategy  in leadership  in political prowess   qualities that are needed to win a big election and lead a government at the centre.rahul gandhi also failed to stitch a formidable coalition  congress could not project itself as an acceptable coalition partner  as seen in uttar pradesh.the congress needs a new narrative  a new orientation and above all a new leader  preferably not from the current  parivar .lessons for regional partiesas far as regional parties are concerned  they should learn a lesson from this election results. indian voters are discerning in their decision making process  and can differentiate between regional and national issues. the bjp s gains in odisha and west bengal show that voters here are ready to place their trust in a national party despite the presence of a strong regional player.in bengal  tmc supremo and chief minister mamata banerjee s minority appeasement policies and aggressive campaigning have become counterproductive  and will eventually lead to her party s fall in the next state election.regional parties should now start governing and stop dreaming about running the central government through proxy. in all likelihood

corruption. then came a series of pro poor initiatives. and finally  the extensive campaign by modi shah dealt a crushing blow to the congress and the shaky gathbandhan.modi s second innings no doubt

lesson for rahul gandhi in       mocking  hinduness  won t work because india is bharat
text size  a  a the unprecedented victory of the bharatiya janata party in the lok sabha elections      is a real victory for indians.political parties in india were used to treating citizens as voters belonging to a particular caste or community. but voters have rejected caste appeasement driven politics in     . and this explains why parties like the samajwadi party  which used to draw support from yadavs  and the bahujan samaj party  which saw jatavs as a vote bank  have failed to win people s mandate.but      results hold out the biggest lessons for the congress. the oldest party in india decided to play the appeasement card to win muslim votes. that explains why congress president rahul gandhi contested from wayanad in kerala  a constituency with a substantial muslim population.also read  rahul gandhi must decide if congress is a european ngo or a party in nationalist indiacongress  anti hindu campaignthe congress went all out to woo muslim votes  clearly creating a communal divide  which ultimately became its undoing.the  left and liberal  advisers of congress leader rahul gandhi took him to the bottom of the pit  making him run a campaign that was anti hindu and driven by muslim appeasement.to stand for  hinduness   which is the soul of this nation and civilisation  was considered  communal  and abused as token  hindu majoritarianism .we are deeply

subscribe nowon the other hand  the bjp ran a campaign  which seemed naturally connected with the bharatiya culture and ethos. to understand this connect  one needs to understand the significance of what narendra modi did after the campaigning for the last phase ended may   .here was a prime minister who visited two of the most sacred shrines in india   kedarnath and badrinath   and meditated in a cave. the opposition  without understanding its significance for a common bharatiya  mocked it.congress president rahul gandhi called prime minister s kedarnath visit a  drama   without realising that such remarks could insult a common bharatiya.such comments are most likely an outcome of a sense of rage  which is felt by several leaders who have enjoyed the fruits of power uninterruptedly for decades. they are now feeling slighted by their continuous rejection by the people of this country.they live with a sense of entitlement and cannot come to terms with the fact that ordinary people can replace them in the power structure  which was built  nurtured and exploited by them.the mandate for narendra modi led bjp and the bjp led nda reflects that such stereotypes won t work anymore.opportunistic alliances failedanother important factor that worked for the bjp was its decision to stick to its ideological core as other parties went for opportunistic alliances.on the one hand  the bjp stood by its commitment to implement the national register for citizens  nrc   which helped it register huge gains in states like west bengal and further consolidate its gains in assam. on the other hand  parties like the samajwadi party and the bahujan samaj party  which were arch rivals for decades  came together in uttar pradesh in an alliance that was rejected by the voters.one of the biggest tactical blunders by the opposition was its inability to provide an alternative agenda of development to the people. since people across the board had significantly benefitted from the welfare schemes run by the modi government  the opposition s only war cry was  modi hatao   defeat modi .also read  modi has turned me into a devdas. was i day dreaming for the past   years  shobhaa deconsolidation of hindusthis      lok sabha mandate is a lesson for all the political parties that bharat votes for those who understand the bharatiya cultural context. modi and the bjp s campaign were deeply rooted in the bharatiya cultural tradition.the message is loud and clear  there is a consolidation of a section of the population  which had been at the receiving end for a long time in the name of  hindu majoritarianism . those who want to come to power need to listen to them  cater to them. they must accept the fact that  hinduness  is at the core of this nation and it s an all inclusive concept and has been deliberately misinterpreted to create a caste and communal divide in this india. the poll results clearly tell us that such politics won t work anymore.also read

rahul gandhi must decide if congress is a european ngo or a party in a nationalist india
text size  a  a indian elections and national security have a seemingly unpredictable relationship.the defeat in the      war with china and the victory in the      war happened immediately after elections earlier in the year and can t be used as gauges. however  the sri lanka fiasco and bofors took a heavy toll on rajiv gandhi  wiping out his government in the      lok sabha elections. the victory in the kargil war propelled atal bihari vajpayee to a victory in     . the       mumbai attacks were undeniably a massive intelligence and security failure  and yet in state elections a few days later  the congress trounced the bjp. confused  so am i.while overarching trends are difficult to make out  there are some allegories that bear repeating. subramanian swamy  for example  recalls how when he met deng xiaoping  and the latter confided to him words to the effect of  we expected india to break up when we defeated you in       yet all it did was wipe out calls for separatism from tamil nadu and bound you together stronger . if memory serves me right  rajiv gandhi said at a congress parliamentary party meet in      that  india is strong in victory  but it is even stronger in defeat.  for the reader s ease  i shall refer to this phenomenon as the deng rajiv principle.also read  as bjp   congress fight over surgical strikes  india s stand on national security is exposedit s a pity  then  that this great leader s son  rahul gandhi preferred internalising superficially applied european social democrat paradigms and ignored his own father s wisdom. what was his cardinal sin  india  like any pre industrial state was  is  and possibly till a post industrial phase  will be  a fiercely nationalistic country. this is not to say indians don t accept that their leaders make huge security goof ups  or their leaders shouldn t be criticised for it  but rather that they believe there is a time and place for such criticism and wartime is not it.this is where pulwama and balakot effectively turned out to be rahul gandhi s proverbial waterloo.assume for a minute that everything the detractors of the balakot strikes and the air battle that followed said were true  that india missed its targets  and the air force did not perform well on that day or the next. the deng rajiv principle dictated  that rahul gandhi stay quiet or express some form of support. instead  he and his press minions went on a rampage calling everyone from prime minister narendra modi  to the air force  liars . a programme on the congress politician supported channel tiranga tv went as far as to verbatim copy a pakistan military linked video regurgitating charges against an italian journalist  who backed up the indian version based on sources on the ground  simply to prove that india s armed forces  and by extension  pm modi  were incompetent.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowit s quite one thing to criticise your government  it s another to end up echoing the official propaganda of your adversary  that too in a fiercely nationalist country  in wartime  on election eve.while this is impossible to gauge  this is where the bjp s  idea of india  as  a civilisational culture  with a deep connection to itself and its past  as yet unexplained by european ideas of a nation state  held true. if you want proof of this concept  look how well the congress did in punjab where captain amarinder singh refused to question the effectiveness of military action and publicly congratulated the government and forces.also read  research shows it makes sense for narendra modi   bjp to focus on national security in     nothing but anger against the congress and its security pr strategy over balakot strikes can explain the fact that the congress has failed abysmally this election  gathering just    seats or seven more seats than its      tally  at the time of writing.there are two sides to this security coin. one is what has been discussed above  the fact that the indian public is forgiving of security failures and does not like criticism at wartime  which it sees as borderline treason . but the other side of the coin  like in       is anger against corruption in defence  which is equally seen as borderline treason . this is where rahul gandhi could have scored a victory over modi with his  chowkidar chor hai  campaign.however  yet again  rahul gandhi has made the cardinal mistake of hurling allegations  without anything remotely resembling proof  not even circumstantial. this was compounded by a supreme court verdict  seen as exonerating the government  and the final disgrace of rahul gandhi having to apologise to the supreme court for misquoting it  never matter that he didn t actually withdraw his allegations .also read  rahul gandhi s congress gets thumbs down  unlikely to cross three figureswhile none of the above narratives seeks to attribute mono causality  we must understand every bit adds up and  in this case  this is how the national security card played out. with the benefit of hindsight  we can assume  and in india  these things are always assumptions  that national security played a big role in the      lok sabha elections.the congress  corruption crusade never got off the ground and was seen as backfiring and alienating people. the party s unintentional echoing of the pakistani line on balakot simply pushed that alienation past the point of no return.ultimately rahul needs to decide what he wants to run  a european esque ngo with internationally fashionable positions  or a political party in a nationalistic country. till then  it is safe to say national security will always favour the bjp  unless rahul gandhi replaces his national security advisers.the author is a senior fellow at the institute of peace and

   years after rajiv gandhi s death  a look back at the ltte lanka nexus that killed him
text size  a  a between      and       i reported from sri lanka more than a dozen times  made many friends  and lost most of them to violence. but no tour of duty was more revealing than the one following rajiv gandhi s assassination on this day    years ago. here s the reconstruction i wrote this series  first person second draft  which i began in       should have begun with a thank you note to shoojit sircar  one of our new breed of young and thinking filmmakers. his landmark madras caf  marked a new beginning in hindi cinema because it stayed much closer to the real story  which is one of the saddest in our history  the ltte led terror  war with the indian peace keeping force  ipkf  in northern and eastern sri lanka  and the assassination of rajiv gandhi.of course  there was much fictionalisation  some for the convenience of storytelling and some for political caution. but there was enough for somebody who saw these events up close to go back to the story  and then tie up some ends with current research to retell it. that is why shoojit s work gave me that nudge to start putting together a reporter s memoir of sorts. publishers have often approached me to write one  and i have routinely fobbed them off with a permanent  lazy journalist s excuse  editors write books between jobs.inspired by madras caf   i tried an unconventional approach to that memoir in the form of this series  where i will try and revisit  say  some    of the biggest stories of our times that i was witness to. and don t get alarmed. i won t be inflicting this on you in a never ending serial  but only occasionally. first person  in this series comes from the idea that i confine myself to my first hand experience. and  second draft  because the passage of time gives you the benefit of reflection and hindsight to see what you covered in real time in fresh light. these stories were done in different periods in years spread over the indian express and india today.i was assigned to follow up on rajiv gandhi s assassination within about    days  as the first indications of a sri lankan connection emerged. i was already an old sri lanka hand  having been both lionised and demonised in that country. but more about that later.i landed in colombo in the first week of june     . the first person i called was lalith athulathmudali  former defence and internal security minister  once a rising star in sri lankan politics  and one of the most brilliant and articulate politicians i have ever met in the subcontinent.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowby now  however  he was much diminished. politically  he was marginalised in opposition to president ranasinghe premadasa. and physically  he was a wreck. a bomb aimed at president j.r. jayewardene in the sri lankan parliament in      had landed in lalith s lap instead. he was a medical marvel  living with hundreds of pieces of shrapnel in his body. to describe the lalith i met in      as a pale shadow of the man i knew from      will be a phenomenal understatement.politically  physically and even personally  he had no resemblance to the man then seen as sri lanka s p. chidambaram  then a rising star in rajiv s government  although nine years younger   and not only because they were both harvard graduates handling sensitive internal security portfolios in their respective countries. they were both brilliant and articulate  but measured to the extent of sounding cold by the subcontinent s garrulous standards. lalith was also benazir bhutto s friend  and preceded her as president of the oxford union.but this afternoon  there was desolate quiet in his home. there was no offer of a full evening with a meal and cognac. i graphically remember  on the other hand  the surreal presence of a valet in a red muslin sari like wraparound  a white blouse and petticoat  a few strands of beard   evidently a transvestite   serving us tea. something was very  very odd with proud old lalith  the ladies  man. so you ve come to find out who killed rajiv  i will tell you   he said   the same gang that tried to kill me and failed  but will succeed eventually.  which gang  lalith  let s be specific   i said. it is the ltte  of course   he said   but it isn t just the ltte. this b     d is also hand in glove with them   he said. he was referring to his president  premadasa. you have really got shaken up  lalith   i said.  how can you make such a serious allegation   i was quite sure that he had gone completely unhinged. you know nothing  my friend   he said. this b     d killed vijaya kumaratunga  later president chandrika s matinee idol husband and peace activist  fondly described as the amitabh bachchan of sri lanka . this b     d killed ranjan wijeratne  lalith s successor in the national security ministry   he also got rajiv killed. i survived once but he will finally get me killed. he will get gamini dissanayake  another prominent opposition leader  killed too. then  i am sure  he himself will get killed eventually. and you  my friend  do not ask too many questions here. you know too much. in fact  the sooner you go back the better   he said.then he made another sensational claim. at the peak of ipkf operations in sri lanka  he said  premadasa was supplying arms to the ltte. and to add a touch of absurd irony  in tata trucks gifted to the sri lankan army by india. he gave me copies of some government documents as evidence  which i could use without attribution. on the record  he had this telling line that we then published   when we get angry with someone  we may slap him. the ltte will simply kill him. also read  when rajiv gandhi had a whale of a time in lakshadweep  and performed a  heroic  actevents later proved he had not gone unhinged. he was just desperately scared and bitter  but still brilliantly  and tragically  prescient. everything he predicted came true.almost exactly two years later  april       a gunman killed lalith. initially  premadasa blamed the ltte  and produced the body of the usual suspect  a young tamil with a cyanide capsule in his mouth. a commission later indicted premadasa  and among others  a band of mobsters  three of whom were mysteriously but predictably killed. just eight days later  premadasa too was blown up by an ltte human bomb at a may day rally.you want to know some gory details  it was in the course of that honeymoon with prabhakaran that the ltte got this adolescent tamil masseur to inveigle his way into premadasa s household. the president was soon obsessed with the boy. so much that he took him along on his travels and nobody cared to frisk him. so he came  as was usual as a  soldier  of the ltte  with a bomb belt  and gave premadasa a final hug of death. the only place where lalith got his script a little wrong was in the timing of when gamini  the new claimant to jayewardene s legacy  would be killed. he was shot and bombed at an election meeting by the ltte  a year after premadasa.and his other  more bizarre claim of premadasa arming the ltte  in a long interview with me  published in the    may      issue of india today   prabhakaran decided in cold blood to kill rajiv    the new sri lankan president  chandrika bandaranaike kumaratunga  confirmed that fact unequivocally. even as a wreck  lalith had been right on everything he said  beginning with his assertion that the ltte had killed rajiv. of course  nobody has as yet found out if there was a premadasa connection.the ipkf had been the first to pick up that bizarre nexus between prabhakaran and premadasa. lt gen. amar kalkat  the ipkf commander who finally turned the tide in sri lanka  had prabhakaran cornered in his kilinochchi jungle dugout. i remember exchanging notes with furious ipkf officers then who always suspected that raw was playing a double game  that it did not want prabhakaran killed as he was india s leverage with colombo. the army suspected that raw tipped prabhakaran off more than once as they closed in.in mid       i  along with photographer shyam tekwani  travelled through jaffna  trincomalee and batticaloa  and spent time with kalkat  who generously had us flown in his mi    to all his three division headquarters    th    th and   th  and this conspiracy theory was the common ops room and mess whisper. there was also talk of the ltte s sudden new firepower and even a bitter  diabolical suspicion sometimes that raw was behind it. but soon  it became evident that an incredible new alliance between prabhakaran and premadasa had come into being against a common enemy  the ipkf.posters appeared overnight in central colombo  describing the ipkf as innocent people killing force. and with m. karunanidhi s dmk a member of v.p. singh s new coalition in new delhi  the ipkf s mission was now well and truly over. prabhakaran had lived to fight and kill another day. in this case  he took revenge on rajiv for sending the ipkf  and probably  rewarded  premadasa for being such a loyal ally.in that endless story of deceit  shoojit s film got another sequence right  though the timing is advanced by three and a half years. it is the  raw inspired  but failed rebellion of the ltte number two  mallaya   who is then betrayed by a compromised raw officer and executed by prabhakaran.this is a real life story. but the man in reality was mahattaya  a nickname or nom de guerre for gopalaswamy mahendrarajah  effectively the ltte s number two. he played along with both raw and premadasa  and most likely the latter betrayed him  leaking details of his secret meetings with a senior raw functionary  chandra   chandrasekharan . mahattaya was executed along with his     loyal soldiers by one firing squad near chavakachcheri in jaffna. but this happened on    december      and not before rajiv s assassination in may       as the film claimed.the other thing the film got right  but mixed up the time frame  was the betrayal by the raw station chief in chennai. k.v. unnikrishnan  a      batch ips officer  had been caught by ib counter intelligence in        compromised  to the cia. he had apparently done india s cause real damage  but had nothing to do with rajiv s assassination much later. one of his daughters was a talented shooter and  apparently  the cia handler cultivated him by routinely gifting him boxes of sport ammunition  which were then imported and expensive.the next step was a honey trap  using a pan am stewardess  and blackmail. a story just like madras caf  s bala s. unlike bala  who shoots himself  unnikrishnan was in tihar for a year and then  in one of those eternal mysteries of v.p. singh s short tenure  released. fired from the ips  he is now said to live a quiet life in chennai. and his daughter s talent was for real. she won several shooting medals for india and is an arjuna awardee.back to lalith now. and different sorts of conversations with him through heady cognac evenings. an early      story   an ominous presence in tamil nadu   india today     march       had given me notoriety in india and instant fame in colombo. it had revealed  for the first time  the existence of sri lankan tamil guerrilla training camps in india. south block was furious. the charge of being anti national was made by none other than mrs gandhi  and in public. of course  colombo did its best to  enhance  that charge by putting that story on thousands of pamphlets and distributing them all over the world. my central point was  we were feeding a monster and it would devour us.therefore  when i first landed in colombo in september       for what was to be my first real foreign dateline  i was received very warmly  actually lionised.i was given the privilege of an invitation to the national security minister s  lalith s  home. he was reputed to be arrogant  dismissive  an anti tamil and anti india hawk. but we became such friends in the first meeting that i got a repeat invitation the next evening at his farmhouse  where he introduced me to his wife srimani.he pointed to a framed picture of theirs with giani zail singh on a visit to rashtrapati bhavan and spoke   vainly  as was typical of him   of how gianiji  taking note of his wife s fair dutch burgher complexion  said she looked like a punjabi. of course  he later wrote a formal letter to me  complaining that i used particularly unflattering pictures of his with my stories.the next day     september  was a sad one for indian cricket. i was in the press box as we lost our first test match ever in sri lanka. it was such a big story the next morning that it blanked out on the front pages the anti tamil riots which had meanwhile broken out in trincomalee. the strategic port and resort city was barred to the foreign press.since that was the only real story in sri lanka then  i still decided to hop on to the train to trinco. it involved some elaborate lying. i told lalith  as well as hardeep and lakshmi puri  then senior diplomats at our high commission  hardeep has been serving as union minister for urban development and is now a bjp lok sabha candidate from amritsar  while lakshmi worked with un women in a key position  that i was going to kandy to watch the third test. lalith frightened me by saying he may be coming there too and would send for me in the press room during lunch.i proceeded to trinco nevertheless. the only name i knew there was commodore justin jayasuriya  the sri lankan joint operations commander  joc . i had had reporters  luck finding myself next to him on the indian airlines flight from madras to colombo. since he was an nda alumnus  we found some common acquaintances  and he gave me his number in trinco. he was also generous enough to grant me an audience at his headquarters as i reached his burning city.also read  how rajiv gandhi   such a nice man   won and ruined india s biggest mandatetrouble came the next morning. taking pictures of a tamil temple being burnt by a sinhala mob  helped along by the armed police  i  along with a british freelancer and his girlfriend dressed in no more than a bikini with a sarong wrapped like a ridiculous fig leaf  was arrested by the same soldiers  who locked us up  threatening to shoot and throw our bodies on the street.i dropped the two names i thought might work. lalith athulathmudali and commodore jayasuriya. any reporter with some experience would tell you that one thing that rarely fails with armed forces in the subcontinent is throwing rank at them. but my lie was more elaborate. i said i had to have lunch with lalith the next day so i must be on that train to colombo this evening. and that the joc himself was supposed to ensure i presented myself before his minister in time.after some haggling  i was allowed to call the commodore  who  though confused  figured something was wrong and asked for me to be released. he also promised to leave word with lalith s office that i would keep my  date  for  lunch . sure enough  i was on that train to colombo  and it turned out to be the last for many years. the next day  the ltte blew up a bridge and it wasn t rebuilt for a very long time.the next morning s colombo dailies had me on page one  at the very top.  controversial indian journalist so and so arrested while taking pictures of sensitive military installation in trincomalee but let off with a warning in a gesture of goodwill . hardeep puri was the first to call me with a mouthful   though only with kindly concern. i later learnt he too had found out about my arrest and had pulled strings to get me freed.it was different later that evening  as i was asked to present myself at lalith s home again. you deceitful liar  i thought you were an honest young bloke   he said   and you even lied to my commander that you had a lunch date with me. what if i had said no you didn t  i really had no answer. so i let him vent. and you told me you were to be in kandy. i actually thought i d give you lunch so i looked for you there  you liar. who can ever trust you with stories you publish  i reminded him  gently  that his government did. enough  in fact  to print my story out in its propaganda pamphlets  to my great embarrassment.lalith gave me another stern look  but a mock one  then both of us laughed  drank some more cognac and became friends  never mind that he was    years my senior.postscript  lalith s wife srimani took over his party after him but died of cancer in       at just   . in colombo  i checked on his daughter serela and was told she had moved overseas. commodore jayasuriya  who saved me much discomfort and probably my life  i was told  rose to number two in the sri lankan navy and now lives in london. i do walk around on my visits as a tourist to colombo now to check out old haunts and

not gandhi dynasty  but a narasimha rao like figure can save the congress now
text size  a  a who will save the congress  after the last and final phase of the lok sabha polls  the time has perhaps come to ask this question. although the results are not out  most take as a fait accompli that the congress will lose badly.back in january  before the heat of the general elections had risen  congress president rahul gandhi made an important announcement. his sister  priyanka gandhi vadra  was finally entering active politics. she was immediately elevated as party general secretary  fast tracked to the centre stage by virtue of being a member of the ruling family. i wondered at that point if she would be the  x factor  if not the secret weapon in the congress arsenal.her performance so far shows that she is still a crowd puller  speaking better and showing greater poise than her elder brother. certainly  she is not given to making gaffes and committing unforced blunders as rahul is wont to. there is hardly a statement reliably attributed to her that is careless  insensitive or foolish. quite the contrary  she exudes a quiet confidence and dignity in the midst of all the hullabaloo of indian politics  what with its mud slinging and bare knuckle boxing.but at the end of the campaign season  it is amply clear that her impact has been rather tepid  way below expectations  if not virtually inconsequential. the reason is obvious. it is the family s protective shield around her that has dulled and diluted her impact. when all eyes turned to varanasi  narendra modi s constituency  there was a conspicuous absence of any noteworthy opposition. in       arvind kejriwal himself fought a losing battle against the bjp s prime ministerial candidate. this time around  let alone offering the semblance of a straight fight  rahul gandhi has allowed modi a walkover.also read  modi and rahul gandhi were friends in      lok sabha polls   whenever the enemy was mediawouldn t it have been strategically significant  not to say brave  to field priyanka gandhi as the combined opposition candidate  why did the congress balk  even if priyanka had lost the elections  she would have earned the electorate s respect. modi himself would have had to treat her  as a much younger rival  with kid gloves. given how age and gender sensitivities play out in our elections  modi would have had to be very careful how he attacked such an opponent. history has shown that we become only as great as the causes we espouse and the opponents we fight. by taking on an opponent as great as modi  priyanka would only have gained in stature.but such a spectacular contest  which might have been the dramatic if not the dream finale to a closely  even bitterly  fought election  did not take place. the congress retreated. some say that  behenji  mayawati also objected to a seat being wasted  but this is an unlikely argument given that the  mahagathbandhan  has little chance to win varanasi either.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their

protect the family at all costs. rahul too  in fact  fled from the hindi heartland to the safe seat way out in wayanad  signalling the rout of his party and his own shaky candidature in amethi. so what if he does win and vacate this seat for priyanka  it would be too little too late against the modi groundswell.this brings us to the third and some might consider the most astute member of the family and still its head  sonia gandhi. during this election  we never saw her campaigning. it was as if she had left the field to her children  completely withdrawing from active politics. her family fiefdom  the rae bareli seat  however  seems reasonably secure. perhaps  the bjp agreed to leave her alone this time.also read  a rebuttal  reducing priyanka gandhi to her love for rahul   similarity to indira is unfairthe real question is what will happen to the family if the congress loses again  will its hold on the party diminish or unravel  will there be greater inner party democracy if not an internal revolution  will the party reorganise and rejuvenate itself to remain relevant  even survive  or will the once mighty congress  india s greatest political formation and the mother of all other political outfits in the country  feebly and tamely fade away in an inglorious  anticlimactic  tragic demise perhaps  the answer lies somewhere in between  in the tension and play of opposing forces within india s grand old party. the family is still strong  united and stable  but some sort of post election reformation  if not leadership change  will be inevitable. how it is effected remains to be seen. but the lead will have to come from the family itself. in this transition  both rahul and priyanka need to play a crucial role or risk losing the plot. they must consider how to cede power without altogether surrendering the reins of the party.for any thriving democracy  a strong opposition is essential. the hodgepodge of squabbling regional parties  which themselves are mostly family run  is not the answer. although they will remain the third pole of india s three cornered polity for some time to come  the role of the congress as india s principal national opposition party is still intact. now that the gandhi family can no longer lead the congress to victory  they will have to rethink how to remain in the reckoning.also read  sibling support  not sibling rivalry behind priyanka gandhi joining rahul s congresssecularism  socialism  populism  minority appeasement  disguised communalism  and doles will no longer suffice to keep the congress pot boiling. nor will the unquestioned supremacy of the gandhi family. so  who can save the congress  perhaps  a second narasimha rao like figure can re build the image and appeal of the party as a credible opposition without totally sidelining or antagonising the family. such a figure would need not only considerable leadership qualities  but grassroots support and financial clout too. also  humility and cunning.despite some names being bandied about  it is not clear who will seize this opportunity or on whom the mantle of the saviour of the congress party will fall. on the day that rajiv gandhi was assassinated with an rdx laden explosive belt some twenty eight years back in sriperambadur  his surviving family members may well think of how best to save the party he led and died

modi and rahul gandhi were friends in      lok sabha polls   whenever the enemy was media
text size  a  a we may know the winner in the      lok sabha elections only on thursday  but the sure shot loser is already confirmed  the media  the fourth pillar of democracy that was.there is a reason narendra modi didn t bother to take even one question at his first press meet in india in five years. the prime minister had all the time to recall in details how  satta bazaar    that was predicting     for the congress and around     for the bjp in      elections   had lost billions when he came to power but he wouldn t entertain any question from the press.he just didn t care. it was not only because he could communicate directly with the people but also because he knew the media is hugely discredited today   more than ever before.ask the political reporters who were out in towns and villages trying to get a sense of the public mood. one of them working for a leading english daily was in sholapur in maharashtra  chatting with one sushil gaekwad   as he identified himself. gaekwad was singing paeans about modi and balakot air strikes when an acquaintance passed by addressing him as  sandip . sensing puzzle on the reporter s face  sushil gaekwad gave a sheepish grin and revealed his true identity   sandip bhosale.  you never know about visitors from delhi   he tried to explain. as the conversation with the reporter progressed  sandip s views about the modi model of governance had changed.also read  tamasha tv for a tamasha pm  how indian media covered modi this electionanother reporter with another english daily was in patna  talking with a turbaned gentleman from delhi s punjabi bagh. he started by saying out that he had voted for modi. five minutes into the conversation  the gentleman was defending every single action and word of aam aadmi party s arvind kejriwal. did he really vote for modi  only he knows.a group of reporters stopped at a  lassi  shop in union minister manoj sinha s ghazipur constituency in uttar pradesh. the youngster at the shop  a yadav  declared his allegiance to  akhilesh bhaiyya  and offered many reasons. as the reporters walked back towards the taxi  he came running    don t take me wrong. my vote is actually for modiji.  the journalists could take their pick.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowthere are scores of such anecdotes involving journalists who visited different parts of the country to cover elections. puzzled and confused  they have come up with their own interpretations. some call them  silent voters  who wouldn t reveal their minds. others see a  fear factor  that prevented the people from speaking out their voting preferences. and a few speak of how indian voters have become  intelligent  and  sharp .also read  narendra modi interview no exception. indian media rarely asks pms tough questionsthe fact is that the media is losing the voters  trust. it clearly has among large swathes of population who  likely taking cue from the leaders they follow  routinely target journalists on social media for even news reports. it was never easy for political reporters to gauge the mood of voters. but people used to be welcoming and open to them even if they refused to spell out their voting preferences. it s different now. political reporters are given to seeing conspiracies but they can t explain why they are now greeted with unmistakable smirks  mocking tones and apparent distrust.the media may have itself to blame for losing people s faith and confidence  by often crawling when asked to bend by the powers that be. the political class may have a myriad differences today due to conflicting interests but they are united when it comes to discrediting the media. all of us saw the people laughing and cheering every time modi  as a prime ministerial candidate in       poked fun at the media in his election speeches.long before the  chowkidar  modi took over the country s reins  rahul gandhi  then aicc general secretary and now congress president  called journalists  thieves . the opposition leader is full of sympathy for journalists today as he has discovered that they are  scared of speaking out  in the modi regime and become  pliable  when they interview modi.as for the ruling dispensation  long before donald trump s white house moved to deny accreditation to non pliable journalists  modi had shut down the media s access to his office  pmo  and took adequate measures to make his administration leak proof.also read  dear pm modi  you re spending too much time on twitter and have got the media wrongin the past five years  the media has been under constant attack for allegedly being  partisan  and  ironically  it has come from both the ruling and the opposition leaders. the prime minister himself has led the charge and accused the media of being biased against him.  are you a congress spokesman or neutral media   has been his usual refrain when confronted with a probing question. when gen  retd  vk singh triggered a controversy with his  presstitute  remark  modi chose to praise his works and  salute  him.the free press may not bother about the fact that the country s most popular leader  his principal political challenger and every tom  dick and harry

bjp or congress  regional players look all set to decide india s next ruling party
text size  a  a after seven phases of voting spread out over six weeks  on    may          india will count the votes from its mammoth general election. while the lion s share of media attention to date has focused on the fortunes of the ruling bharatiya janata party and the country s principal opposition party  the indian national congress  the final result could hinge on the performance of dozens of smaller parties in the fray.in indian general elections  the two premier national parties do not fight elections alone  rather  each party heads a front or coalition of parties consisting of smaller  typically regional or caste based  parties with whom it shares a pre poll alliance. these dueling alliances the bjp led national democratic alliance  nda  and the congress led united progressive alliance  upa  involve bespoke seat sharing arrangements that amplify a national party s reach and stature  especially in regions where it may have a limited presence. smaller coalition partners  in turn  earn a shot at national power if their front emerges triumphant.these dueling coalitions are not fixed in time. rather  constituent members regularly switch sides depending on the whims of their party leaders  state specific policy concerns  and sheer political expediency.for instance  the rashtriya lok samata party  rlsp   one of the bjp s smaller allies in bihar  exited the nda following a seat sharing spat ahead of the      polls. this time around  the rlsp teamed up with the congress and other opposition forces to take on the nda. similarly  some parties that were unaligned in      have migrated to either national front in the intervening years. for instance  the janata dal  secular   a key regional party in the state of karnataka  joined the upa following its decision in may      to put aside past differences and form a regional government in conjunction with the congress.also read  no ajit doval  from indira to modi  majority govts are overrated. don t fear coalitionsfigure   demonstrates the contribution  in terms of votes and seats  that allies have made to the bjp and the congress over the last three general elections in             and     . in       the congress won     seats on its own a far cry from the     it needed to earn a majority  there are     directly elected seats in the lok sabha  or lower house of parliament . however  the congress s allies added another    seats  bringing the upa s total to     a gap the congress easily bridged by bringing on additional postelection partners.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowin       the bjp contested the elections with its coterie of nda companions. although the bjp won a majority of parliamentary seats on its own  as figure   shows   its allies played an important if unheralded role. in many states  the support of alliance partners expanded the bjp s vote share and fueled its victories in seats where it may have otherwise fallen short. perhaps as recognition of this fact  prime minister narendra modi technically heads a coalition government with many cabinet portfolios manned by members of parliament  mps  representing the wider nda family.pivotal coalitionsin       coalitions will likely play an even more decisive role  given that most pre election surveys suggest neither the bjp nor the congress will be in a position to form a government on its own. indeed  the congress has focused on a decentralized campaign strategy in which state specific alliances will consolidate opposition votes in an effort to defeat the bjp. for instance  the congress has stitched up coalitions in key states such as bihar  jharkhand  and maharashtra with the sole objective of defeating the bjp and its allies. it also boasts alliances in other states like kerala and tamil nadu  where the main opposition is not necessarily the bjp but a dominant regional player.however  on the ground realities do not always back up the congress s rhetoric about fighting this election as part of a unified opposition front. for instance  in the election s most pivotal battleground the state of uttar pradesh  which boasts    seats the congress is not part of the mahagatbandhan  grand alliance  of opposition parties steered by the bahujan samaj party  bsp  and the samajwadi party  sp   the state s two leading regional parties. after defeating incumbent bjp members in three key hindi heartland states chhattisgarh  madhya pradesh  and rajasthan in a set of state polls in december       the congress felt this wind was at its back. as a result  it drove a hard bargain with potential partners in the general election. many regional players felt that the congress was overplaying its hand and balked at the party s perceived arrogance.also read  regional parties will oust bjp in       chandrababu naidu throws weight behind coalition planthese parties may have a point  the disaggregated election results from december show that the congress only made sizable gains in seats where the bjp was the incumbent party  see figure   . in chhattisgarh and madhya pradesh  congress performance actually declined in seats where it had been the party in power. the congress may have mistaken anti incumbency sentiment for a pro congress wave.by contesting uttar pradesh on its own  the congress threatens to divide opposition votes  although congress president rahul gandhi recently intimated that his party would not put up its strongest candidates where it lacked a solid chance of winning the seat outright. the opposition also stands divided in the state of delhi  where the congress was unable to forge an understanding with the aam aadmi party  aap  the ruling party in the state. a divided opposition in delhi helped the bjp sweep the state s   seats in      and could do so in      as well.the bjp entered this election season facing turmoil within the nda s ranks. in march       a principal ally the telugu desam party  tdp   the ruling party in andhra pradesh exited the coalition in the wake of a major policy dispute. several smaller parties  from the marumalarchi dravida munnetra kazhagam  mdmk  in tamil nadu to the jammu and kashmir peoples democratic party  jkpdp   also broke off ties with the bjp. however  over the past several months  the bjp has rebounded and cobbled together a formidable alliance for the      campaign.in the state of tamil nadu  where the bjp holds just one seat in parliament  the party struck up an alliance with a constellation of regional parties led by the ruling all india anna dravida munnetra kazhagam  aiadmk . despite heated rhetoric about an impending divorce with the bjp s longtime ally in maharashtra  the shiv sena  the two set aside their differences and finalized their partnership for     . in some instances  the bjp went out of its way to placate allies by giving up seats it once held. in the state of bihar  for instance  the bjp cemented an alliance with its on again  off again partner the janata dal  united  by giving it    seats  the bjp will contest another    and a smaller ally  the lok janshakti party  or ljp  will contest another   . in granting    seats to the jd u   the bjp effectively pushed aside five of its own incumbent mps. this gesture either signified goodwill or anticipated anti incumbency sentiment.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in

there is a gandhi and a godse inside every indian. we must make peace within us first
text size  a  a it is amply clear that not only was there the wider conspiracy to kill mahatma gandhi  the indian government at the time too was a complete failure in protecting him  with its efforts bordering on complicit negligence. there had already been one failed attempt to assassinate gandhi less than two weeks ago. and lest we forget  the indian government at the time was led by jawaharlal nehru  our first prime minister  gandhi s anointed heir and successor  as well as the mahatma s closest  most loyal acolyte  sardar vallabhbhai patel.gandhi s assassination was a terrible personal blow to patel. some believe that he never fully recovered from it  himself passing away a couple of years after  on    december     . needless to say  the guilt of the mahatma s death  bordering on the horrible stain of patricide and coupled with the macabre partition of india  constitute the twin traumas that mark the birth of our nation.what this shows at the very least is that to blame godse alone is collective self deception  if not futile self absolution. worse  it might actually be political wickedness. the very people who use the ghost of godse to tarnish the rss and the bjp themselves stand condemned in the dock of history for their failure to protect the mahatma. they must come clean and say sorry publicly rather than blithely and facilely shifting the blame to an invented bogeyman cum murderous monster called  hindu terror. also read  there s a lobby that wants to keep nathuram godse alive. and it s not the hindu righthowever  there are still a few more loose ends in the intriguing puzzle of why the ghost of nathuram godse still stalks the land. godse  whether we like it or not  was no ordinary criminal or killer. he was not even a trained or hired assassin. he was  instead  an austere  gita quoting  self made intellectual and newspaper editor. on the masthead in an oval inset of agrani  the broadsheet he and narayan apte edited  was the image of none other than their hero and inspiration  vinayak damodar savarkar.it is reported that godse visited savarkar to seek the latter s blessing before leaving for delhi. allegedly  savarkar even blessed him with  yashasvi houn ya    come back victorious. what is the source of this information  it is the testimony of digambar badge  a member of the assassination squad  who turned approver and state witness. savarkar stood trial but  for lack of evidence  was not convicted for gandhi s killing. indeed  both godse  who he never looked at even once during the long drawn trial  and apte  sedulously refrained from implicating him in the conspiracy though they could easily have done so.godse s shadow still haunts the hindu psyche traumatised by the twin tragedies of the partition and mahatma gandhi s murder. it is because somewhere in our wounded past  many of us also wanted gandhi dead  if not physically then at least figuratively.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers

as a girl  saw gandhi as an  effeminate  father who didn t protect mother indiathe difference is that godse was prepared to die for his crime while we want to live on comfortably. that godse bowed before the man he killed or was devoted to the same book that the mahatma swore by  the bhagavad gita  are only some of the many ironies of hinduism. the fact is that there is both a mohandas and a nathuram in most of us. it is this startling and disturbing truth that kamal hassan  now notorious for calling godse independent india s first  hindu terrorist   tried to convey in his moving period pic hey ram.until we accept and make peace with the gandhi and godse within us  both their apparitions will continue to startle  surprise  and provoke us from time to time. the healing of the fractured hindu psyche can only happen when they not only come to terms with their historical defeats at the hands of both the islamic and the western colonial invaders  but also with their differing  sometimes glaringly contradictory  reactions to this defeat.these latter range from denial  victimhood  outrage  revenge to a more considered and balanced commitment to a new renaissance based on the great legacy of a truly glorious past and an even more promising  knowledge inspired future based on real competence  skills  and visionary dynamism. however  for this to happen  there must be a new and abiding covenant between the hindus and the muslims of the subcontinent  a cause that gandhi most certainly staked his life for.also read  when nehru s india banned a story on gandhi s murder and godse s pastunfortunately  the last seems a tall order for most indians  let alone hindus. certainly  it is much greater and more demanding than simplistic and reductive political posturing for

godse  raised as a girl  saw gandhi as an  effeminate  father who didn t protect mother india
text size  a  a a historical account of nathuram godse and the men who killed gandhi tells us something unusual about his childhood. three of his elder brothers died soon after birth  but his elder sister survived. his parents thought that there was a curse on the boys in the family  and it led them to take a religious pledge to bring up the next son as though he was a girl.accordingly  the next son  ramachandra  was made to wear a nath  nose ring  and was brought up just like a girl till the next brother survived infancy. that is how ramachandra became nathuram  the ram who wore a nose ring. the historical account suggests   psychologists may find some explanation of his warped mental processes in the fact that nathuram was brought up as a girl . we do know that nathuram went on to become a  strapping  young man  but did not marry and  shied away from the company of women .is this story relevant to the current controversy about godse  not quite  if our question is whether he should be called a  terrorist . to my mind  the more interesting question is whether and in which sense should he be called a  hindu . the story of nathuram s childhood gives us an insight into the impulse that lay behind his brand of hinduism and  by implication  into a bigger question of our times.also read  there s a lobby that wants to keep nathuram godse alive. and it s not the hindu rightlet us first dispose of the first question that excites news channels  was kamal haasan justified in saying that nathuram godse was the first terrorist of independent india  the outrage against haasan is ridiculous on various counts.first  this was not the first time kamal haasan was making this statement. i was present and with him when he made the same statement on    april this year before mahatma gandhi s statue at the marina beach in chennai. somehow  the media did not pick it up. this time  when the locality was predominantly muslim  this became a headline.second  it is clear that he described godse as an  extremist   theeviravadham  and not a  terrorist   bayangarvadham . now  even godse would have been disappointed if he were not called an extremist we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowthird  kamal haasan did not describe godse as a  hindu extremist  but as  an extremist who was a hindu . if you read this in the context of the full speech that he gave  there is little to be debated. the speech is about communal harmony and abjuring all forms of extremism.in any case  the debate on  hindu terror  was started not by kamal haasan  but by prime minister narendra modi. in his now infamous speech at wardha  maharashtra  the pm asked the audience   over the last thousand years  can you name one hindu ever involved in an act of terror  you can forgive him for this mix of arrogance and ignorance. or  turn a blind eye  as the election commission did. or  you could give him an answer  yes sir  have you heard of nathuram godse also read  when nehru s india banned a story on gandhi s murder and godse s pastkamal haasan s statement can be read as the much needed response to the pm. if the pm s question  and all the rabble rousing that went with it  did not violate any law or model code of conduct  how come haasan s sober and factual response becomes a problem even if godse was described as  terrorist   is that wrong  over the last two days we have heard a lot of warped logic  this was a simple murder  not an act of terror  as if godse had a property dispute with the mahatma   godse was an assassin  not a terrorist  as if an assassin cannot be a terrorist   he surrendered on his own  as if no terrorist ever surrenders  once the job is done   he was tried and punished  as if the punishment cleansed the terror tag .godse s act fits all the key attributes of what we today call terrorism  gandhi s assassination was unlawful  violent  pre meditated  ideologically inspired  targeted a non combatant  meant to send a wider political message and intended to stop a category of people from pursuing a given course of action. what else is terrorism let us turn to the more interesting question  was godse a hindu  in the most obvious sense  he was. born into an orthodox chitpavan brahmin family  he was and remained a hindu. godse was hindu in a secondary  political sense as well. like his political guru v.d. savarkar  he thought he represented the hindus. in his eyes  what he did was to avenge the humiliation of the hindus.if militants in punjab were called  sikh militants  or terrorists who wreak violence in the name of islam are  islamic jihadis   then godse was  and many of his ilk are   hindu extremists . if we do not use hindu as pre fix  as we should not  then we should drop religious pre fixes for everyone.but did godse represent hinduism in any deeper sense of the term  if he did  why was he so vehemently opposed to the man who insisted that he was a sanatani hindu  we must turn to ashis nandy  one of our iconoclastic intellectuals  to decode godse s anger against gandhi. in a seminal essay written four decades ago  nandy described gandhi s assassination as the  final encounter   as the inevitable culmination of a tension that lies at the heart of modern india   godse s hand was forced by the real killers of gandhi  the anxiety ridden  insecure  traditional elite concentrated in the urbanized  educated  partly westernized  tertiary sector whose meaning of life gandhian politics was taking away. that brings us back to the story about godse s childhood. for godse  hindus were feminine  being constantly violated by outsiders. he saw gandhi as the effeminate father of the nation who was unable to protect mother india. he wanted hinduism to attain the masculinity that the colonial rule represented. gandhi represented the affirmation of the feminine self  long enshrined in the hindu ideal of the ardhnarishwar  a composite  androgynous divine form  half male  half female . this reflected in the deeper divide. like savarkar  godse looked up to the european ideal of centralised  uniform nation state. gandhi wanted decentred power and accommodation of differences  even beyond the boundaries of the recently constituted indian nation. brahmanic hinduism was godse s ideal. according to nandy  gandhi s hinduism was debrahmanic.also read  we ve trained our kids to kill  husband of hindu mahasabha leader who  shot  gandhigodse s political hinduism represented the western  european and victorian sensibilities  while gandhi represented indigenous hinduism. this divide gets replayed today. what is called  hindutva  today represents godse s legacy  playing out his deep anxieties. gandhiji was assassinated. godse was hanged. but gandhi vs godse is a live battle. it is a battle for the soul of india. the

holiday when he was at the helm.as controversy broke out  then commanding officer of ins viraat vice admiral vinod pasricha  retd  and then flag officer commanding in chief of the southern naval

viraat with the gandhi family. questionable actions were  however  in evidence. india s premier warship  ins viraat  was used to transport the gandhis and moved in the arabian sea for    days. its daily expenditure at sea is astronomical as the viraat travels with an entire retinue of escort ships   the      report by journalist anita pratap said.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers

expense was also incurred in setting up a special satellite link up at agatti for the duration of the holiday   the report further said.if this was indeed the case  then it will be the first time when a democratically elected leader commandeered prime military assets for personal holiday with family and friends.however  both vice admiral pasricha and former navy chief admiral ramdas denied that

can our water  power woes hit data localisation plans  new bjp or congress govt must answer
text size  a  a one of the key challenges the new government will have to face after the lok sabha elections  be it a bjp or a congress led alliance or a federal front coalition  is data localisation and assuring foreign investors and states about the disruption associated with it.rbi s notification  justice b.n. srikrishna led committee s report  and the draft e commerce policy have all called for data localisation without explaining how such a step will benefit india.for a move that could define the future of domestic and international data in india  a cost benefit analysis would be much appreciated by the industry  academia as well as civil society.cost  resources and security are fundamental to localisation. its impact on ease of doing business and the start up ecosystem as well as the geopolitical implications of other countries following india s lead are yet to be understood in full. india needs to work out a comprehensive cost benefit model so that people can get a holistic picture of data localisation.also read  governments must not shy away from taxing google   facebook for your personal datagoing forward  data and where it should be kept are set to be the most important issues in india s technology policy.the questions to ask are   why does it matter where data is stored and is data localisation a wise choice we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers

demandshuge amounts of data are stored and processed at data centres. these data centres and server farms  regardless of their location  require big investment and resources to be set up and maintained. for example  it costs nearly     million to set up a data centre in brazil     per cent more than in the us  and about      million to maintain it annually  more than twice what it would cost in the us . bulk of the maintenance cost is spent in meeting energy and cooling requirements.global data centres  according to an article in forbes  used roughly     terawatts   .   x      watts   or about   per cent of the global electricity supply  in       nearly    per cent more than the entire united kingdom. and this power consumption will double every four years.data centres also demand lots of water for cooling  and electricity generation  purpose. in       american data centres collectively required nearly     billion gallons of water  a number that is expected to go up as server farms grow bigger and larger. and  this is before we even talk about the internet speed required for optimal functioning.also read  indian worker may lose     of monthly salary if data localisation becomes law  study saysit only makes sense to establish server farms in locations where such resources are available in abundance and at cheap rates. further  they should match the global security standards so that companies can ensure user trust in them.electricity and water are both commodities that india does not have in abundance. as of       an estimated     million     crore  people in india did not have access to electricity  according to the iea. the niti aayog estimates that     million     crore  people face a severe water shortage in india  and the situation will only get worse with the water demand being twice the supply by     .in a scenario like this  it seems irresponsible to devote these resources to data centres when our people need them more.learning from global practicesalso  locating data on indian soil may not necessarily give the government jurisdiction over it and is unlikely to raise the current security standards.even if localising data may protect it from international threats  chances are that this would make it more susceptible to domestic threats. there is also the argument that providing the government with access to people s data could result in nsa like programmes  which enable mass surveillance.when we consider where data should be physically located  the cost of data centres  availability of resources  and how it impacts the security are important variables.countries like canada and australia have localised sensitive data  such as health records. this comes with the perceived benefit of having an additional layer of security when there are global concerns regarding increased foreign snooping in the wake of snowden s revelations.however  localising data  when we don t have jurisdiction over it  does not change who can access the information. this is not to say that localising data is necessarily an unwise decision  but to suggest that the reasons behind the decision are spelt out clearly.the capital investment needed to achieve localisation cannot be accumulated overnight. the roadmap for how to keep data on india soil should be drafted in consultation with various stakeholders. it should also include the issue of how to identify and deal with entities that fail to localise.also read  india s data localisation may not protect privacy but could damage businessesthe silver lining is that there is evidence of coherent intent across all the state actors involved in data localisation policy making. what the process may lack in transparency is more than compensated in action.as india aims to grow as a global leader in emerging technologies  where data is kept will be important. however  regardless of the solution that india ends up adopting  it needs to engage with all the stakeholders on this subject.the

as bjp   congress fight over surgical strikes  india s stand on national security is exposed
text size  a  a in a national security driven lok sabha election  india is now witnessing a  my surgical strike vs their surgical strike  battle.alarmed by the impact of the bjp s pitched rhetoric on security  the congress sprang a surprise in the middle of the elections when former prime minister manmohan singh said that  multiple surgical strikes took place  during the upa tenure as well. subsequently  congress leaders gave specific examples of the  surgical strikes   providing details regarding the date and target areas  across the line of control  loc .heated political exchanges and media debates followed. prime minister narendra modi mocked the congress  claim and asked if these  surgical strikes  were  on paper  or  in a  video game .defence analysts and veterans joined the debate  with some saying that a number of trans loc strikes and trans border strikes in myanmar and bangladesh have been carried out over the last two decades.the debate was eventually reduced to the interpretation of the term  surgical strikes  and how september      special forces tactical raids and balakot air strikes were different from the trans loc border military operations carried out earlier.also read  in balakot  india tested a new military reaction much different from      surgical strikeswhat s a surgical strike the term  surgical strike  is not defined in the official indian military manual   glossary of military terms   where all military terms are very specifically defined to avoid exactly this kind of misinterpretation. this term  however  is part of the military jargon and open to varied interpretations. the army used it for the first time with respect to september      tactical raids without actually formally defining it.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowthe term s early usage can be traced to the     s     s with israel s hostage rescue   operation thunderbolt   at entebbe on   july      and later its air strikes on iraq s nuclear reactor   operation babylon   on   june     . it is centred around the idea of avoiding collateral damage and escalation  particularly in operations below the threshold of war. the moral dimension is to avoid killing civilians and destroying civilian infrastructure. land air sea based precision guided munitions are best suited for such strikes.however  other military operations carried out by special or regular forces on specific targets without causing collateral damage also qualify as  surgical strikes . all other qualifying attributes like  political will ownership    strategic nature    depth of penetration    terrorist targets  or  number of enemy soldiers terrorists killed  or  extent of damage caused  are mere semantics to justify a point of view.apart from the operations carried out in the period immediately before or after our declared conventional wars  there have been several trans loc border operations. as early as    april       our canberra reconnaissance aircraft was shot over pakistan and two pilots were taken prisoners of war.also read  if india continues to politicise military  we may not look very different from pakistanwhat s different now the narendra modi led bjp government has declared and  owned  the trans loc special forces raids carried out on    september       the trans international boundary raid carried out in myanmar on   june       and the trans border air strikes on balakot on    february     . the political decision to declare and own was  no doubt  strategic  although the operations were in the tactical domain.earlier  trans international boundary operations on terrorist targets in myanmar and bangladesh  and the military operation in maldives had specific political sanction. however  no formal political sanction was given for trans loc operations. these operations were carried out by the army either with tacit political approval of the government or under its mandate to ensure that india s borders remain safe.record or no record  that the tricolour flies on pt       captured by    sikh on   april      to secure    sq km of  our territory in pok  in karubar bowl in chorbatla sector  is an undeniable fact.policy of strategic restraintno government has articulated a formal national security strategy with clearly defined political aims and a desirable end state with respect to our adversaries. in the last    years  no long term budget allocation has been planned to create the desired military capacity. interaction with the military has been limited and political directions have been informal and ambiguous.also read  narendra modi govt wants a strong military  but its defence budget can t guarantee thatthe functional security strategy of the atal bihari vajpayee government  kargil and operation parakram notwithstanding  and the two congress led upa governments was  strategic restraint . this implied that nuclear weapons are a deterrence to decisive wars  that india needs to focus on its economy  that we must manage the proxy war in jammu and kashmir in a humane way and neutralise pakistan through engagement and diplomacy.vajpayee and manmohan singh both believed that loc was the de facto international boundary and its sanctity must be maintained. this strategy formed the basis of india s internationally accepted moral stand during kargil and its diplomatic engagement with pakistan.hence  all our trans loc operations  when required  had to be covert. no formal clearance was ever given. yet  with the tacit approval of the government or under mandated  freedom of action  to the army  this    year period saw the maximum trans loc operations  barring the pre  and post      and      period. this period also saw the fatalities in terrorist violence drop to their lowest in     .the major flaw of this strategy was that it failed to make the people of jammu and kashmir participate in the political process. the other flaw was india s inability to create the desired overwhelming technological military edge.modi government lost patiencethe narendra modi government initially adhered to the same strategy till      with satisfactory results.however  due to its ideological pull  its frustration with the pdp in the coalition government  the post burhan wani killing agitation in       and the uri terror attack on    september       it lost patience. without much thought  the modi government decided to pursue a  hard strategy  in j k and a  strategy of compellence  with respect to pakistan with the declared and owned trans loc raids by special forces on    september     .this was a standalone one off operation  which was not followed up by escalation despite pakistan sponsored terror activity increasing manifold over the next two and a half years.however  this operation provided the government an opportunity to advance its version of nationalism for political purposes. the military became a part of chest thumping nationalism and national security the central electoral theme. the pulwama terror attack  the balakot air strikes  and the aerial skirmish on    february  despite the obvious stalemate  just seamlessly fitted into the bjp s political strategy.also read  how      surgical strike was different from the ones congress is claiming under upawith the probability of even a limited war being low  the success of a  strategy of compellence  with operations below the threshold of war hinges on an overwhelming technological military edge  which we neither have nor have made any efforts to create. hence  we are in no position to compel pakistan and it will adhere to its strategy of a calibrated proxy war.having raised people s expectations  it is not pakistan but india  which will have to remain in a permanent crisis

     lok sabha elections more polarising than       which saw the fall of indira gandhi
text size  a  a the      lok sabha elections are proving to be truly momentous. many commentators would say that even in      and      or      and       the tension was palpable. but i do not remember any election being as polarising as this one. not even       which ended the emergency and indira gandhi s reign.the spectre of democratically elected authoritarian style rule or parliamentary chaos has begun to haunt several political leaders and intellectuals. communal confrontations or collapse of order is feared in west bengal and jammu and kashmir.the veneer of normalcy is deceptive. i have been covering elections since      and have not been as stumped as i am today.interaction with various sections of people in different parts of the country reveals dormant angst and anxiety. even a simple list of options that emerges from these discussions show the complexity of the situation.the big question playing on everyone s mind is  who will be sworn in as the prime minister in the last week of may  and will narendra modi get majority on his own  what will happen if the bjp gets       seats less than the     it won in       will he then resign on moral or political grounds or will the bjp replace him  citing lack of confidence  will he be replaced by nitin gadkari or rajnath singh or someone else  will the national democratic alliance  nda  recommend nitish kumar as pm if it fails to get enough post poll allies also read  for voters this election  rahul gandhi didn t start the fire. that s the problemsimilar questions are being posed about the future of the congress led united progressive alliance  upa . who will be the likely consensus candidate for pm if upa manages majority in lok sabha  will it be rahul gandhi  mayawati  sharad pawar  naveen patnaik  ashok gehlot

are clearly facing a tough challenge from their opponents.the tina argumentpolitical tension is building up across the country  and election forecasts have reached a feverish pitch. from corporate rooms to family drawing rooms  press clubs to marriage ceremonies  there is heated speculation about the numbers the bjp led alliance and the opposition would get this election season.i wonder how the anchors  commentators and panelists embedded by narendra modi and amit shah in tv studios would conduct debates if the bjp fails to get     seats. they could still argue that the party is single largest in the house and modi should be called to form the government even if the opposition parties together have more numbers.also read  what do modi haters say when confronted with the tina factor give him a chance and enough time to establish majority  would be their argument. a similar situation had reportedly emerged in karnataka recently and in goa in      where after the election results  frantic efforts were made to cobble together the numbers.the embedded media would  of course  be euphoric if rahul gandhi is defeated  the congress  seat tally remains below      and the opposition fails to get majority in lok sabha. this would give them yet another opportunity to say  there is no alternative to modi .argumentative indiansduring this election  not just the media  many people from the legal fraternity  some retired generals  professors and other such  educated experts  from the upper middle class have become dedicated  alter egos  of narendra modi. their so called arguments at home or in offices are essentially ego clashes.india hasn t seen such ego investment in any election or in any leader as in modi. there are heated arguments but no dialogue  there are high decibel fights but no conversations around modi. these are the new  argumentative indians  who cannot listen to any counter point or argument.when the results are declared on    may  hundreds and thousands of egos are going to get deflated. if modi cannot get majority or is not able to form the government  there could be a parliamentary gridlock or a constitutional breakdown.also read  the      election is just about narendra modi  not bjp  sangh or even oppositionin the next few weeks  we will know if this is just a hyperbolic apprehension or the political system has degenerated to

rajiv gandhi to nuclear button  pm modi has made it amply clear he s panicking this election
text size  a  a polling in two thirds of all parliamentary constituencies in the lok sabha      elections is over  and voting in the fifth phase has begun today. poll experts appear befuddled over which direction the election is trending. television anchors with cameras accost voters with questions on voting intent  analysts wrap their heads over inane voter turnout data in the hope of spotting a trend  foreign journalists and social media warriors spout opinions collected from anecdotes in their election tourism expeditions.yet  all this has only generated more noise rather than any real signals. the larger trend of the      elections is the phenomenon of the silent voter and the extreme localisation of national elections.also read  with   clean chits to modi  ec made it clear  bjp varanasi nominee is free to say anythingthere are some very clear takeaways thus far in the      elections. one  there is no  wave  for the ruling party  as in       as even the most ardent supporters of the bjp will admit. two  there is a silent clamour for change. three  for the first time in recent memory  a ruling party is seeking re election not on its performance in the last five years  but on some intangible idea of nationalism. four  this is not a national election  at best it is an election of    different states  but it is more like a      constituencies  election. five  traditional methods of election forecasting by using vote share from a survey of voters across the country to predict seats is defunct.there is no clearer evidence of a lack of a      type wave than the campaign rhetoric of prime minister narendra modi that plumbs to deeper lows with every phase of the election. from threatening to use the nuclear button to claiming that the opposition parties dream of his death to mocking the death of former prime minister rajiv gandhi who was assassinated brutally  modi has made it abundantly clear that he is in a state of absolute panic and despair over how the current election is trending for his party.the elevated hopes of hundreds of millions of voters in      and the subsequent dashing of them have led voters to become more sceptical and transactional about the      elections. voters are increasingly more concerned about the tangible impact on their daily lives such as jobs  incomes  prices etc.  rather than some vague national or ideological pursuits. such tangible needs also vary widely across constituencies and states.also read  here s how many seats congress can win in      lok sabha electionswe are deeply grateful to our readers

sterlite issue is the defining electoral issue in tuticorin  tamil nadu while stray cattle is the defining issue in maharajganj in uttar pradesh. thus  the      election has got very localised and feels like     different elections. this means that the voter s behaviour in this election is not being shaped by some national narrative  but by local factors such as the menu of choices on their ballot  substantial ideas that impact their livelihoods immediately and their trust in candidates.with elections becoming localised  there is an accompanying desire for change at the constituency level. but this desire is silent and cautiously expressed. we have run multiple experiments across various states to survey the same set of voters with the same set of questions on the same day but in different contexts  only to find that the responses vary dramatically depending on the interviewer and the circumstances. we find that a supporter of the ruling nda is much more vociferous and expressive than the one desirous of a change. in other words  a non bjp supporter seems far likelier to abstain from responding to questions or falsifying their preferences  if forced. this is referred to as the  silent voter  phenomenon in political science. the most famous observation of the  silent voter  phenomenon in the indian context was in the      lok sabha elections.this silent voter phenomenon could also explain why    per cent of exit polls since      across all state elections have been wrong. our analysis of     exit poll seat predictions of    state elections since      by the most frequent four polling agencies   cvoter  axis  csds and chanakya  show that they were wrong    per cent of the time.also read  why voters don t turn up in larger numbers in lok sabha elections   all politics is locallocalised elections combined with a severe  silent voter  problem have rendered most predictions by pollsters erroneous. in order to be able to accurately survey and predict  one must survey every constituency with a well stratified sample that does not induce a ruling party bias. this is an expensive proposition. most pollsters in the country lack the resources and the know how to do this.where does all this leave us with the current lok sabha election  in states such as tamil nadu  the desire for change is loud but in states like maharashtra  there is a strong but subdued vote for change. at this point  i can venture to say that it is sufficiently clear from our extensive surveys of every assembly constituency with a large sample size that at the end of the first four phases of polling  the congress party with its pre poll alliances is ahead of the bjp and its pre poll alliance parties.now  you are entitled to dismiss this as the opinion of a biased sample of one person  i can only submit that there is strong empirical evidence to back this claim.the author is the chairman of the data analytics department of the congress party. views are

now we know who is behind the massive funding gap between bjp and congress  the corporates
text size  a  a it was widely reported last year that the indian national congress  inc   the main political opposition and a contender for power in the      polls  has ran out of money. divya spandana  who leads the party s social media wing  openly confessed that the inc has no money to run its mundane political activities. it appears that the oldest national party does not have the funds to run its offices in several states and senior functionaries were asked to cut down their travel expenses.while this may come as a shock to fans of the party which was in power not very long ago  key statistics of its finance clearly indicate the party is in a tight spot as far as donation aggregation goes. while the congress raised rs     crore for the year in question  it spent about rs     crore   more than rs    crore from the earned donations. this prompted party president rahul gandhi to make an urgent appeal for donations last year.while      was an extraordinarily tight year for the congress party considering that the party fought a spate of state assembly elections including the electorally significant rajasthan  chhattisgarh and madhya pradesh requiring considerable expenditures  the fact is the party s coffers have been experiencing a sharp decline in funds ever since it lost power in     . the declared income of the party for fy         was its lowest in    years  and    per cent lower than the previous financial year.figure    comparative flow of bjp and congress incomefigure    bjp income as percentage of the inc incomefigure    cumulative donation to

define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowever widening funding gapwhere does the congress party stand when compared to the ruling bharatiya janata party  bjp   while the congress party is ahead of other national parties in terms of total donations  raised by various means such as membership fees  sale of coupons  individual denotations  electoral trusts  electoral bonds  rents from properties  etc   the oldest party earned less than one fifth of what the ruling party received in        . as per the income tax returns and annual audit reports of both national parties  the congress party raised about rs     crore in donations for the year  compared to an impressive rs       crore by the ruling party. to put it differently  in the combined income of the two biggest national parties  the congress s share was a meagre    per cent  figure   .in terms of donations above rs         the bjp raked up rs     crore in fy         compared to rs    crore by the congress party for the same year. overall  the ruling party earned    times more than the combined similar donations received by other national parties  including the congress party.not a very long ago  the congress was at the pole position in political donations. for instance  in       it raised about rs     crore against rs     crore by the then main opposition party  bjp. if one goes back a little further  the ruling congress in      raked up as much as  .   time more donations than the bjp. however  the congress party s fortune started to slide after it faced a flood of allegations of corruption and big ticket scandals around          which coincided with the rising stock of the once dormant bjp. even before it assumed power in       the opposition bjp surpassed the ruling congress in political donations. for instance  while the congress raised rs     crore for the fy          the bjp collected as much as rs     crore for the same year  figure   .figure    comparative statistics of corporate donation to the bjp and the congressblame corporate donors for the growing dividethe bjp s phenomenal rise in capturing more than    per cent of the total donations and the congress s sharp deceleration are closely linked to how they tapped the corporate donations. for example  the bjp in fy         tapped a staggering    per cent of the total corporate donations  figure   . this disparity is even starker when compared with the congress  while the bjp received as much as rs     crore of the corporate donations  the congress party received as little as rs    crore in fy          figure   . to put it another way  the bjp tapped    times more of corporate donations than the congress could in fy        .of course  the bjp for long has been occupying a pole position in tapping corporate donations. even when the congress party was in power  the bjp collected more money from businesses and corporates. while the ruling congress party could raise about rs     crore in the years          the bjp tapped rs     crore in the same period  figure   . still  the gap in corporate donations then was modest  compared to what it is now. since       the business corporate donors have contributed a whooping rs       crore to the bjp  while the congress received only rs     crore.electoral trusts fuelling funding disparitieswhat is contributing to this growing gap in corporate donations between the two major national parties  while the usual explanations that the bjp has a close proximity to small businesses and trading communities and also are aggressive in tapping donations still hold good  a key contributor to such growing disparities in corporate funding are the electoral trusts. in its less than a decade long existence  electoral trusts have emerged as the biggest channel for corporate donations in india. since       more than two thirds of corporate donations are being routed through this route. some of the richest electoral trusts have been donating generously to the bjp  rather than to other national parties  including the congress party. of the    registered electoral trusts and their donations for fy          the bjp received    per cent of the total contributions. for example  the richest prudent electoral trust contributed a staggering rs     crore  around    per cent  to the bjp alone. the congress party received only a paltry rs    crore from the same trust for the said period. further  since its formation in       the prudent electoral trust has donated rs    .   crore     per cent  to the bjp  out of its total rs    .   contributions.the story does not end with the electoral trusts alone. now with the electoral bonds  where more than   .  per cent donations are of high value indicating their business links  also in the game  the gap in corporate donations is growing wider. in       the ruling party collected as much as    per cent of the donations routed through the electoral bonds. the audit and income tax reports of the bjp suggest that the ruling party received rs     crore of the total rs     crore donated through the electoral bonds in march     . the congress received a meagre rs   crore for the same period.too much gap not good for democracyof course  one cannot blame the ruling bjp for collecting more money than the other national parties. with close proximity to business and trading communities  it always finds its easy to raise more funds than the congress. yet  the gap was never so wide as it is now. while the bjp s spectacular victory in the      general elections and its phenomenal spread over many states allow it to win over the corporates and big donors  the congress s drastic slide in the donation basket has no easy answers.has the opposition congress lost the confidence of business community or has this something to do with the party s uncertain political prospects  whatever be the reason  such a large gap in political donations between the ruling party and the principal opposition does not augur well for the health of the democracy. while income or donations is by no means a clear indicator of winning in elections  campaign finance literature does offer enough insights into how political parties with well oiled campaign machines often have a disproportionate advantage over their cash starved rivals in mounting effective campaign communication

how does rahul  of the tainted gandhi dynasty  expect to damage modi s image  arun jaitley
text size  a  a dynasts have self illusory opinion about themselves. they create a disproportionate image about their own abilities in their own mind and believe that the universe around them thinks alike. they tend to become megalomaniacs. rahul gandhi is no exception. he announced four months ago that prime minister  narendra modi  will lose in varanasi and that the bjp will be reduced only to a couple of seats. he has a disproportionate impression about his oratorical skills when he challenges one of the greatest communicators of his times  prime minister modi  for a public debate. he comes out with outrageous ideas about security  economy and social issues and believes that his views have found mass acceptability. with prime minister modi s personal acceptability ratings today being close to      rahul proclaims that he is dead sure that modi is very unpopular. the irony of every dynast is that he buys his own propaganda even if there are not too many others willing to accept it.dynasts have a sense of entitlement. they believe that they were born to rule. gandhis suffer from this sense of entitlement. the      election was an utter shock to them. losing to a person of modest origins and being reduced to the lowest ever strength in history  became unacceptable to the dynasty. it took them more than three years to get out of the shock of the      rout. the strategy devised was that modi had to be fought and removed. he was considered a strong and a popular leader. his delivery systems were extremely clear. he enforced honesty in public life. he was a strong performer on the security front. the  kaamdaar  was being admired for his work. unacceptability of a commoner challenging the dynast and defeating him led to both envy and revenge. rahul s statement quoted in a media organisation yesterday that  i have dismantled modi s image  was a give away. the only way a dynast with a little acceptability in the country can react to the commoner who defeated him is that  i will damage his image.  but how do you damage the image of a person who is riding perhaps at the peak of his popularity  how do you damage the reputation of a person who is known to be incredibly honest  can image be destroyed by a person who belongs to a family which has been tainted through generations with charges of corruption  how do you claim to have succeeded in damaging the image of a powerful personality where prime minister modi s acceptability ratings are close to     and rahul is finding it difficult to even breach the     mark its clear that rahul gandhi concocts falsehood  as in the rafale case  starts believing his falsehood to be true and eventually dreams that the falsehood has destroyed his opponent. he does not gauge public opinion. he only talks but does not listen. such people surround themselves with advisors who have also tactically learnt to only give good news to the dynast. rahul s attitude is at complete variation with the traditional congress way of doing things. his revenge against prime minister modi may not succeed. it may well turn out to be a revenge against the congress.this article was republished from arun jaitley s blog.also read  elections have become a convenient season to suddenly discover religion  arun jaitleysubscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis   only you can fix it you are reading this because you value good  intelligent and objective journalism. we thank you for your time and your trust. you also know that the news media is facing an unprecedented crisis. it is likely that you are also hearing of the brutal layoffs and pay cuts hitting the industry. there are many reasons why the media s economics is broken. but a big one is that good people are not yet paying enough for good journalism. we have a newsroom filled with talented young reporters. we also have the country s most robust editing and fact checking team  finest news photographers and video professionals. we are building india s most ambitious and energetic news platform. and we aren t even three yet. at theprint  we invest in quality journalists. we pay them fairly and on time even in this difficult period. as you may have noticed  we do not flinch from spending whatever it takes to make sure our reporters reach where the story is. our stellar coronavirus coverage is a good example. you can check some of it here. this comes with a sizable cost. for us to continue bringing quality journalism  we need readers like you to pay for it. because the advertising market is broken too. if you think we deserve your support  do join us in this endeavour to strengthen fair  free  courageous  and questioning journalism  please click on the link below. your support will define our journalism  and theprint s future. it will take just a few seconds of your time. support our journalismshow full article

london wale ya lutyens  wale   was sambit patra s more acidic query. by the way  the bjp spokesperson is back on air  sporting a freshly acquired tan from his campaign in the backwaters of

 lok sabha elections were to be decided in the tv studios of news channels  rahul gandhi would win easily and handsomely   and he wouldn t require the services of a raga tv channel to win. while prime

by forcing paswan to campaign in amethi  amit shah has burnt ljp s congress bridge forever
text size  a  a ram vilas paswan is at the lowest point in his almost five decade long political career. paswan recently received a message from bjp president amit shah  who asked him to go to amethi and campaign for bjp candidate smriti irani  who  like       is challenging congress president rahul gandhi. since ram vilas paswan s lok janshakti party is part of the bjp led national democratic alliance  it sounds very innocuous and ordinary that the bjp would want him to campaign for one of its candidates. paswan duly obliged and shared the stage with smriti irani in amethi sunday and also posted images on social media.but ram vilas paswan  and perhaps amit shah as well  knew the larger connotation of this election rally. campaigning in favour of smriti irani  but most importantly against congress chief rahul gandhi  has a larger political implication for ram vilas paswan  who not only shares  or at least used to share  a cordial relation with united progressive alliance  upa  chairperson sonia gandhi but was also a minister in the first upa government and a member of rajya sabha during its second term            .it was quite natural therefore that ram vilas paswan would be reluctant to the idea of campaigning in amethi. his arguments that he was preoccupied in bihar where his party is fighting elections on six seats failed to have any effect. his son chirag paswan s veiled threats to pull out of the nda could have prompted the bjp to offer the senior paswan a rajya sabha membership from assam  where there will soon be a vacancy  and make him not contest the lok sabha elections. it helps the bjp that paswan s son and two brothers are in the fray in bihar and their chances of winning the election depends on support from the saffron party. with little bargaining power  ram vilas paswan had no other option but to agree to campaign in amethi.also read  from lalu   paswan to tejashwi   chirag       marks a generational shift in bihar politicsthere is not enough clarity on why amit shah insisted on ram vilas paswan campaigning in amethi. paswan has no influence in that area and his dusadh caste has no presence in the central uttar pradesh. he would have been of some importance if the bjp had utilised him in the eastern uttar pradesh. it seems that amit shah wanted ram vilas paswan to attend the rally in amethi for the same reason that the latter was reluctant to do so   campaigning against congress in their bastion will burn the bridges that paswan had so meticulously cultivated over such a long time. this would also ensure that in a post election scenario  it will be difficult for ram vilas paswan and his ljp to switch sides and join the congress led camp.ram vilas paswan has used such bridges too often in his political journey. he started his political career as a prot g  of socialist leader and former bihar chief minister karpoori thakur  and became an mla in      on samyukta socialist party symbol. but he soon left the party to join another socialist formation led by raj narain  who later became the health minister in the union cabinet in     . paswan was in the opposition camp during the emergency  served time in prison and later joined the janata party to win the      lok sabha election from hajipur constituency. he still very proudly remembers his presence in the guinness book of world records for winning an election with the highest margin.it will require a whole lot of research and analysis and googling to document ram vilas paswan s political journey  especially the parties he joined and left and formed and how and why he has done so and what were the consequences. in a nutshell  ram vilas paswan has been part of nearly every political coalition at the central level and has served in almost all coalitions as a union minister  be it the national front or the united front or nda or upa. he was leader of the ruling front in the lok sabha during the regime of hd deve gowda and inder kumar gujral  as both these former prime ministers were members of the upper house. during the change of regime in       when the first non congress government came to power at the centre  ram vilas paswan was one of the contenders for the top job but the congress president at that time  sitaram kesri  put his weight behind ik gujral  which tilted the balance in favour of the politician from punjab.we

nda and joined the ministry. soon after  he left the atal bihari vajpayee government following the      gujarat riots. that  however  did not deter him from joining the narendra modi led nda in     . he does it so effortlessly all the time that political analysts are often left baffled. to cut the long story short  it can be said that ram vilas paswan has been almost everywhere and with everyone. he switched sides so often and so wisely that in the political circles  he is known as the real  weatherman  of delhi who can forecast accurately which way the political wind will blow.there is no point in singling ram vilas paswan out on this count because as far as the ideology is concerned  the differentiating lines in the indian politics are very thin. with a stringent anti defection law in place  the politics of  aaya ram  gaya ram  has come to an end for individuals  but for political parties it has been an easy task to switch sides. we cannot and should not blame ram vilas paswan because he is not the only one practising this politics.i will not criticise ram vilas paswan on this count also because of other reasons  he is not a dynast  he comes from a poor family of dusadh caste  the lowest in the social hierarchy  he did not have any  godfather  in politics  and his survival alone is one of the wonders of indian democracy. he has done all this with almost negligible social and cultural capital. he is hungry for power  yes  but which politician in india is not. ram vilas paswan has compromised on his political ideology  but to compromise is to follow the dominant ideology of our times.also read  no grudge against bjp ally paswan  he hasn t backstabbed us like nitish  tejashwi yadavso  has ram vilas paswan made any forecast about the      lok sabha elections  he hasn t said anything explicitly. but going by the choices he has made  it seems that after having fought many battles  the weatherman of indian politics is not sure about the outcome this time. his party  ljp  has sided with the nda and six of his candidates  including his son chirag and brothers pashupati nath paras and ramchandra paswan  are contesting the elections from bihar. but it remains a puzzle why ram vilas paswan himself is not contesting the lok sabha election. does he fear losing  we don t know. the bjp has promised him a rajya sabha seat. is the ljp chief hedging and taking preventive actions now  maybe yes.it is said that ram vilas paswan s politics is now all about bungalow  the election symbol of the ljp. about two decades ago  paswan was allotted a sprawling kothi in    janpath  adjacent to    janpath where sonia gandhi resides. come what may  ram vilas paswan never vacated this place. this chalet is now his empire where he resides  where he rules. this is his weather office. to retain this bungalow  he needs to be in one of the houses of parliament. by deciding to be a member of the rajya sabha  as promised by the bjp  ram vilas paswan has insured that the bungalow remains with him. with one small  but a very crucial rider   that the bjp must keep its promise. for what it s worth  ram vilas paswan may have already paid the price for the bungalow by campaigning in amethi.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis   only you can fix it you are reading this because you value good  intelligent and objective journalism.

sheila dikshit  the delhi aunty and congress darling  proved politicians never retire
text size  a  a this article was originally published on    april      .sheila dikshit was arguably india s first famous political bahu. she entered politics in      and fought and won elections from uttar pradesh s kannauj  to be followed some years later by dimple yadav. but sheila dikshit is more famous as the delhi aunty  chief minister for    years  a politician who put the civility into civic and the class into capital.so  it is only right that her latest karmabhoomi is the north east delhi lok sabha constituency  where she will be up against the energetically loud manoj tiwari from the bjp and dilip pandey  low key head of aap s delhi unit.diminutive dikshitfor a city that took little pride in its historic past and had even less faith in its future  constantly comparing itself to its smarter cousin  mumbai  the changes sheila dikshit brought to it were no mean feat.from a somewhat bucolic city of itinerant bureaucrats  plucky punjabi refugees and heritage obsessed old dilliwalas  delhi has become a city of migrants  flanked by the millennial city of gurgaon and the commercial residential hodge podge of noida. much of that change  after the first flush of hotel building and apartment construction by rajiv gandhi and his boys for the      asian games  came thanks to dikshit. at last count  she presided over    flyovers  cng changeover of public transport  a swish delhi metro  and most importantly  the idea of participatory government  bhagidari  which created a culture of powerful and responsible resident welfare associations.and they happened so seamlessly  thanks to the diminutive dikshit that the city perhaps grew jaded of its own gilded lifestyle. when dikshit was defeated by the aam aadmi party in       losing her new delhi legislative assembly seat to arvind kejriwal  and the city to his party  there was almost no time to mourn the passing of an era of grace and gravitas.dikshit s unhappiness with a potential alliance with aap in this lok sabha election is well known. in       she admitted she was  bewakoof  in underestimating the popularity of aap in the city. could it be that the woman who once understood the perfect balance of being plu  people like us  in her personal life and plt  people like them  in her professional life  has got it wrong again we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and

sheila dikshit among candidates but leaves one seat outdarling dikshitsheila dikshit was always the darling of the congress  first family. the gandhis respected and loved her.her close relationship with them saw her becoming the governor of kerala in      for five months before resigning once prime minister narendra modi s government came to power  but by then it seemed she was too old  too dated and dare one say  too posh  for the emerging ugliness of electoral politics. a brief experiment in      that saw the party announcing her as chief ministerial candidate for uttar pradesh was again aborted  amidst rumours that she was to be made a scapegoat for losing   it looked like it was all over for her.but if points were to be given for pure unadulterated love for the capital city  dikshit  now     would still win hands down.dikshit s delhisheila dikshit has seen the city from up close since she was five years old  watching mahatma gandhi s funeral procession from her father s shoulders  taking tongas to old delhi  falling in love with ias officer vinod dikshit while on bus no.    back from delhi university s north campus  and meeting her future father in law  formidable uttar pradesh politician uma shanker dikshit  at alps restaurant in janpath  as she has written in her book citizen delhi  my times  my life .and much more than that  she has transformed the city  where she went to school  convent of jesus and mary  and college  miranda house   beyond recognition.defeating dikshither big electoral loss in      was perhaps because in her later years dikshit grew tired of her party s innate ability to sabotage powerful regional leaders but also because she herself perhaps misunderstood the city s new residents and their demands for free water  lower electricity rates  better government schools and basic health facilities.add to that her much bandied about role in the commonwealth games scandal as well as her inability to grasp the strength of outrage against the december      rape of a paramedical student  and it was clear that mrs d. was no longer what india today once called her  a succour mom.but as p.v. narasimha rao s career has proved  politicians in india never retire. they just build up their reserves during periods out of power  eating enough egg white omelettes and popping enough pills.in the case of delhi  there is little choice for the congress  having been unable to build a credible and popular second line of leaders  except perhaps ajay maken. as political analyst kamal mitra chenoy says   sheila dikshit has had a long innings as a charismatic cm. however  nothing is permanent  and time catches up with everyone. it is a pity that she has had to stand for elections at this age. she would have been better advised to groom younger politicians who would have many more years to go in delhi politics. when delhi  the centre of our country is faced with right wing populist forces of the bjp  the delhi congress should have brought together all political forces in delhi to defeat these forces  he says. such an alliance would have been better for their own survival.  the greatest victims  however

why congress  and not sp bsp  is prime target of modi and yogi in up
text size  a  a the bharatiya janata party s war cry in uttar pradesh is   up hee jitayega   which loosely translates to  it is up that will ensure our victory  in the      lok sabha elections. quite surprisingly  however  the duo of prime minister narendra modi and up chief minister yogi adityanath is targeting the congress more aggressively  and not the mahagathbandhan  or grand alliance  of once adversaries samajwadi party and bahujan samaj party. the congress s position in uttar pradesh is such that with two phases of polling done  it is being said that if the trio of rahul gandhi  priyanka gandhi vadra and jyotiraditya scindia manage to take the congress s tally beyond single digit mark in the state  it will be a huge achievement for them.so what explains the bharatiya janata party s focus on choosing the congress as its main rival in the hindi heartland state  which sends the maximum members        to the lok sabha  when political analysts are of the view that any loss for the bjp in up would mean a direct gain for the mahagathbandhan besides the fact that the bjp wants to project a pan indian clash between rahul gandhi and narendra modi  there s another significant factor behind this game plan of targeting the congress  the caste combination of uttar pradesh.also read  for bjp  uttar pradesh strongman rajnath singh best bet to tackle farmers  protestcaste has always been a dominant factor in the electorally crucial state. despite the current atmosphere of communal polarisation in the country  caste is still a deciding factor in most contests. developing political equations in up indicate that division of votes will not be as simple as it is being discussed. this time  the main electoral battle in up is being fought for a group  savarna  or the upper castes  which until now had not been explicitly marked as a  vote bank  for or by any political party. despite caste based polarisation in up since the early     s  savarna votes have remained fragmented. earlier  they used to be the main base for the congress with the bjp eating into its share in later years. both the sp and the bsp have their own core vote banks and neither the bjp nor the congress have found it easy to break them.in such circumstances  the congress s decision to field candidates from    seats is being seen as a ploy to dent the bjp s savarna base. according to the official survey  the upper caste population in up is about    per cent and the bjp s high hopes in the slogan    up hee jitayega    are linked to this figure. in the      lok sabha elections  a larger chunk of this    per cent was responsible for the bjp getting    per cent votes and    seats in the state. in that election  the combined vote share of the sp and the bsp  the parties were not in alliance  was also around    per cent. but the two are not together and any slice in the bjp s    per cent pie can be catastrophic to the party.now  let us have a broad look at the congress s list of candidates and its campaign strategy. it is quite clear that the congress is bent on luring away a bigger share of this    per cent savarna vote base. for example  in gautam budh nagar  the congress fielded its young gun arvind kumar singh against the bjp s sitting mp mahesh sharma and bsp s satvir nagar. locally  the fight was projected as  thakur vs. brahmin.  similarly  a brahmin candidate was put up against gen  retd  v.k. singh in ghaziabad in a bid to split savarna votes. to add to this  even the sp had fielded a savarna candidate  suresh bansal.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowalso read  why priyanka gandhi can be bjp s best friend in      lok sabha electionsin meerut  the same story played out. the bjp gave ticket to its incumbent mp rajendra agarwal while the congress countered his presence by fielding harendra agrawal. rumors abound that the titanic clash between these two baniya leaders has badly split the savarna vote  and that the bsp candidate  haji mohammad yakub  would prove to be the main beneficiary. the bsp is already in a solid position on this seat  which has five lakh muslim and  .  lakh dalit voters. similarly  in mathura  bjp s hema malini has been challenged by congress s mahesh pathak  the president of tirth purohit sangh  who has a huge clout among the brahmin voters.let s now move towards the eastern region of the state. rajesh mishra and devvrat mishra are the congress s candidates from salempur and jaunpur  respectively. both are capable of making a huge dent in bjp s savarna vote bank. similarly  in ghazipur  bjp s manoj sinha is facing a tough challenge from congress s ajit kushwaha  who is claiming support of  .   lakh kushwaha voters in the constituency. kushwahas have traditionally voted for the bjp but it s likely going to be different this time with the congress  candidate being the son of babu singh kushwaha  a well known leader and former minister in the up government.savarna voters also play a big role on prestigious seats of lucknow and varanasi. for the latter  whose incumbent is pm modi  the congress is yet to announce its candidate. in lucknow  which is held by union home minister rajnath singh  however  the congress has deputed acharya pramod krishnan  a tv debate veteran whose fame as the head of kalkipeeth and social position as a spiritual guru is sure to affect bjp s vote share. the sp bsp alliance  which is fielding poonam sinha   also a savarna   is hoping to benefit from yet another thakur brahmin clash. poonam sinha s husband  former bjp mp shatrughan sinha  is a kayastha while poonam herself belongs to a sindhi family. both these castes have a good presence in lucknow. while the kayastha numbers around  .  lakh  the sindhi community also has more than one lakh voters. with the help of the sp and bsp s traditional voters  poonam sinha can pose a serious challenge to rajnath singh in case of a split of the savarna votes.also read  why priyanka gandhi must take modi head on in varanasialthough defeating pm modi in varanasi is a monumental task  one could dare say even impossible  the congress is aiming for a close fight. amid the ever growing rumours that the congress could announce priyanka gandhi vadra as its cahllnege to modi  there are also talks about a  mahant  of a famous temple in the city being a possible contender. the name  though not made known  is of someone considered to be  a liberal brahmin . interestingly  it has never been easy to gauge the shift in the mood  if any  of people in a city where  .  lakh brahmins co inhabit with   lakh muslims.ever since yogi adityantah   a rajput by birth   took the chief minister s chair of uttar pradesh  stories of thakur brahmin clashes for dominance are buzzing in up s power corridor. the bjp s lucknow office is rife with stories of brahmins being neglected under the current regime  both central as well as in up. acts such as denying tickets to veteran brahmin leaders like murali manohar joshi and kalraj mishra have added some credit to these stories. the sentiments were further hurt when ambedkar nagar mp hariom pandey and sant kabir nagar mp sharad triptahi  infamous for beating an mla with shoes  too were left high and dry. hariom is believed to be so annoyed with the bjp leadership that he has leveled serious allegation against the party that he had been asked to pay money to get the ticket. hariom has also gone public with his accusations that the bjp was neglecting brahmin leadership.overall  the congress is looking to benefit from this situation. its intention is to dent this    per cent savarna vote share and demolish the base of bjp s    per cent share it received in up in the last general elections. the alliance of the sp  the bsp and the rashtriya lok dal too can hope to benefit in seats where it has fielded a savarna candidate. everywhere else  the upper caste votes will be shared by the bjp and the congress  and the latter s ability to wean a larger chunk of this vote will mean danger for the bjp  which could end up losing more seats than it is currently anticipated. this strategy may not yield any large number of seats for the congress  it can queer the pitch for the bjp. for the congress  any damage to the bjp in up is sufficient to emerge as a big player in delhi. and so  while the bjp seems hard pressed to confront this two frontal attack from the mahagathbandhan as well as the congress  it is the likelihood of the bigger damage it could face from the congress that makes it chalk up a strategy focused largely on the nehru gandhi family.the author is a senior journalist.this article is translated from hindi. the original can be read here. views are personal.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a

a message for rahul gandhi in milind deora courting mukesh ambani and uday kotak
text size  a  a when mumbai congress chief milind deora got his candidature from mumbai south endorsed by mukesh ambani and uday kotak last week  he might have broken the unwritten code in rahul gandhi s party  that a congressman must be seen as anti rich.one doesn t know how congress president rahul gandhi  a buddy of deora  has taken it. it might be the first instance in recent years of a congressman publicly questioning the  povertarian  politics of his party high command. rahul gandhi would rather have his party leaders speak and act like aspiring robin hoods who wouldn t let the adanis and the ambanis of the world have a good night s sleep. in their personal life  they may go vacationing in foreign climes and travel by private jets but their public persona must be defined by austerity. remember then mandsaur mp meenakshi natarajan             who would turn up late at gandhi s meetings and explain how she was not getting an auto rickshaw outside parliament  this endeared her to gandhi who obviously didn t know that the lok sabha secretariat provides cars to ferry mps.but artists are not always conformists and deora is an accomplished guitarist. he has shown a mature politician s head on his shoulders by seeking out industrialists but if rahul gandhi is not convinced of the political wisdom of his buddy s dalliance with them  he may take a tip or two from kamal nath  nine term member of parliament from chhindwara who secured madhya pradesh for the congress after a gap of    years last december.also read  from nehru to kamal nath  congress  cow politics has always been a balancing acttravel around this election season and you will come across many who agree with rahul gandhi s contention that the narendra modi government has been a failure in providing jobs. but ask them if they will vote for rahul gandhi s party to bring them jobs. they are likely to respond with a hesitant smile  if not an outright  no .kamal nath can show to the congress president how a politician doesn t have to be anti rich to become pro poor. tribal dominated chhindwara used to be an epitome of backwardness with no roads  electricity or water when nath first won from there in     . it is totally transformed today. it s not just because bijli  sadak and paani are not the issues any longer. raymond  hindustan unilever and scores of other big and small companies have their plants set up in chhindwara today. kamal nath  an influential minister in upa government  did wield his clout to get central ministries to set up apparel training and design   training centre  il fs skills development corporation ltd and footwear design and development institute  but his real success was in roping in the private sector.look at the companies that are providing employment opportunities to chhindwara youth at the cii skills training centre  larsen   toubro  jcb  toyota kirloskar  cummins  gmr  voltas and hero motors  to name a few. there are at least    other skill development institutes and centres in kamal nath s constituency  over     km from bhopal  the state capital. a trainee driving a truck in snow  mist and heavy rains in simulated conditions at the ashok leyland institute for driving  training and research in chhindwara can leave you awe struck.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality

electionshow many ministers or parliamentarians could boast of bringing aegis and paytm call centres and tata business support services  bpo  in their constituencies  all these skill straining institutes produce over        skilled youth in chhindwara every year  more than    per cent of whom get placement with salaries ranging from rs       to rs        per month. you have to see the glow on the faces of the youngsters at these centres to understand why rahul gandhi s broadside against the ambanis and the adanis fails to impress the youth.that explains why kamal nath  who has fielded his son nakul nath from his lok sabha seat this time  looks relaxed and secure in chhindwara while rahul gandhi feels insecure in amethi  a starkly backward constituency in terms of development  and optsfor a second  safe seat of wayanad in kerala.rahul gandhi needs to appreciate milind deora s compulsion to get endorsements from mukesh ambani and uday kotak. the aspirational india doesn t look at them as enemies  however much the comrades would like them to read marx s  wage labour and capital  and their conflicting interests. and that s where the congress is failing to read the pulse of the youth. many of them were expecting the moon from modi and have been left disappointed. but rahul gandhi s promise of providing    lakh government jobs   even if that involves coercing the states   doesn t seem to have impressed them. they would rather trust milind deoras and kamal naths to fulfil their dreams but they are no more than outliers in rahul gandhi s congress today.also read  why rahul gandhi s congress is in danger of morphing into a clueless ngofor the congress president  the journey is more important than the destination. he once made headlines riding a bike pillion to bhatta parsaul village  in uttar pradesh  to join the cause of farmers opposing land acquisition. but the congress could never earn their confidence on voting days. it was the same in niyamgiri hills when gandhi went as the  sipahi  of tribals to stall vedanta s bauxite mining project in odisha. they didn t show any trust in the congress in subsequent elections. the party s victories in the recent assembly elections seem to have convinced gandhi of the electoral dividends of the farm loan waiver. it has been his pet theme in all his campaign speeches. in the last madhya pradesh assembly election  the bjp retained all seven   out of eight   assembly constituencies in mandsaur parliamentary constituency  the epicentre of farmers  unrest that was supposedly instrumental in the bjp s ouster from power in the state. but these are minor details in gandhi s larger politics.having said that  the fact is that the congress party s position as a default option in national politics may still secure it a better tally in the next lok sabha   and even more if identity politics holds sway in the hindi heartland. but that would be a reflection on the bjp and modi  and not a vindication of rahul gandhi s politics. on the ground  people are voting either for or against modi and the latter s choice of the alternative may not perforce reflect her preference.there are umpteen explanations for why      is not      but this election is still for modi to lose or win.aside  rahul gandhi is known to take a break abroad after every election to re energise himself. he should

 shehzada  rahul   ahmed  mian  aren t routine jibes on congress  they are modi s bigotry
text size  a  a at a recent rally in maharashtra s wardha  prime minister narendra modi took to the stage to publicly decry congress president rahul gandhi s decision to contest from wayanad in kerala  by suggesting that he was  running away from majority dominated areas  to  take refuge in areas where the majority is in minority . inspired  his colleagues were quick to parrot their leader s line with bjp president amit shah calling wayanad a place  where when a procession is taken out  you cannot make out whether it is india or pakistan  and uttar pradesh chief minister yogi adityanath remarking that the congress believes that  ali  prophet mohammed s son in law  will help them in the polls ..but we think that bajarang bali  lord hanuman  will help us .not that this is the first instance where modi has targeted the congress president or the party in such a manner. at an earlier stage when he publicly derided rahul gandhi  then vice president of the party  as a princeling  he did not use the hindi term  rajkumar   preferring the persian and urdu  shehzada  instead  as if to further damn gandhi by association with islamic terminology. when rahul gandhi was appointed as party president in december       modi insinuated that his appointment would mark the beginning of an  aurangzeb raj  in the party.more frequently  modi has not shied away from labelling the congress as a party of  muslim men   and also an  anti hindu  party  and has on multiple occasions reiterated his hollow accusation of  minority appeasement  that he so often mocks the congress for.also read  the modi playbook  delay in pm condemning attacks on kashmiris is part of a patternto be sure  modi s deplorable obsession with peddling this divisive cocktail of communal messaging is not a new trend and has been documented several times in the last decade. but it is still remarkable how pronounced his bigotry gets when an election is around the corner.in the immediate aftermath of the      godhra riots  when the state went into elections  as the bjp s cm candidate  modi openly suggested that there was an active collaboration between muslims in gujarat and pakistani chief  mian  musharraf. then in september  while campaigning during his gujarat gaurav yatra  on the note of family planning  modi mocked muslims in his state with his  hum paanch  hamaare pachees  comment suggesting that muslims were out to multiply their numbers to reverse their minority status in the state. in the      and the      campaigns  the  mian  barb was resurrected  this time as  ahmed mian   a reference to the faith of congress leader ahmed patel. as recently as last week  at a rally in kathua  modi attacked jammu and kashmir s former chief ministers thus   i will not allow the abdullahs and the muftis to divide the country. even constitutional authorities have not been spared  modi has not previously demurred from targeting the election commission of india itself. in the      campaign  when the ec  wary of the communal tensions in the state  refused modi s call for early elections  as the cm  the latter launched a barely veiled tirade against then chief election commissioner j.m lyngdoh  highlighting his christian background and suggesting that he was favouring minorities in the state by not calling for early state elections  prompting a sharp dressing down from his own party colleague and then prime minister atal bihari vajpayee.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowalso read  rahul gandhi is as polarising as modi but indian liberals won t use that word for himthis is not just a diatribe about how modi and his bjp have lowered the level of political discourse in india  it is to point out how exactly they do it. in cricket nowadays  the umpires use a  soft signal  when they are unsure of a verdict on an appeal but want to convey to the tv umpire what they really think. this is exactly what modi is up to  he actively signals his bigotry to his base without necessarily being overt about his distaste for minorities.during the      bihar assembly elections  there was his exhortation not to vote for the rjd  twisting its leader lalu prasad s words to say he had  insulted yaduvanshis  by calling them  beef eaters . two years later  in uttar pradesh  there was his  kabristan shamshaan  comment and his  if there is electricity during ramzaan there should be electricity during diwali   innocuous enough till one recognises the implicit communal message packaged within . in the same year  during the      gujarat assembly elections  modi repeatedly accused his predecessor manmohan singh and former vice president hamid ansari of colluding with pakistan with the aim of defeating the bjp in the polls. both statements were designed with the specific intent of polarising the electorate prior to the elections. in       in the midst of the karnataka state elections  modi hit out at the congress   celebration of the jayantis of sultans   a reference to the celebration of tipu jayanti in the state.this brings us to the foundational paradox of narendra modi that i have documented extensively in my own book  the paradoxical prime minister. it is striking that the modi who assured a gathering of muslim leaders in      that even if they were to knock on his doors at midnight  he would respond  is the same modi who refuses to wear a muslim skullcap when one is presented to him  while cheerfully donning all manner of exotic headgear wherever he goes . silence is also a weapon of soft signalling  when he refuses to condemn instances of communal violence  he implicitly condones it.also read  pulwama balakot helps modi in polls   issues of farmers  jobs  rafale don t exist anymorethe modi who has effusively embraced muslim heads of state in the arab world  is the same modi who keeps indian muslims at arm s length. never before      had a political party in india won a majority at the centre without a single muslim representing it in the lok sabha  till modi s bjp achieved that dubious distinction. this was all the more astonishing in that    of its seats in the lower house came from uttar pradesh  where nearly a fifth of the state s population are muslims. the very fact that the bjp finds itself unable to put up electable muslim candidates in any constituency speaks volumes about the party s attitude to muslims and of the attitudes of indian muslims to it as well as of the views of its core voters  whose bigotry would not predispose them to vote for a muslim  not even one contesting on their own party s symbol.modi needs to stop this divisive and infantile practice. the incumbent of   and again aspirant for   the country s top post must be above such bigotry. as rahul gandhi has shown he understands  his language should demonstrate an appreciation that a prime minister of india must be a leader of all indians and not one with an ostentatiously displayed blind spot for certain minorities. our country deserves better than the bjp s torch bearer for bigotry that modi has become  a position from where he has sadly lost the moral integrity to lead this nation.dr shashi tharoor is a member of

why priyanka gandhi must take modi head on in varanasi
text size  a  a suspense is the word congress president rahul gandhi has used to answer whether priyanka gandhi vadra will contest the lok sabha election from varanasi against prime minister narendra modi.suspense is often what the congress party has to offer. it keeps building up suspense for weeks and months and sometimes years  only to become a diwali fire cracker that fails to light up. phuss  it s called colloquially.one recent example of this was the proposed alliance with the aam aadmi party  aap  in delhi. another is how the rumour of priyanka gandhi entering public life carried on for so many years it didn t have meaning.when the congress did launch priyanka  at the fag end of modi s first term  it was too late for her to make any impact. she and her brother both made it clear they were looking at the      assembly election in uttar pradesh  implying they knew priyanka wasn t going to have much impact in up in      lok sabha election. this is how the congress undermines itself  all the time.the list of things the congress party gets wrong is long. but there are a few things it is as poor in as timing. it doesn t know when to strike. when the iron is hot  the congress party goes into a slumber.also read  this election  a lot of people are rooting for a weak modidon t chicken out of ithow about varanasi  priyanka gandhi casually told congress workers in raebareli last month. having created the suspense herself  she must not chicken out of it now. already  bjp mouthpieces who call themselves news channels have been hyping up the idea of priyanka gandhi contesting from varanasi  so they can later say she lost her nerve.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowif priyanka gandhi now decides to not contest from varanasi  it will make modi appear even stronger   in varanasi and india alike. the unmistakable message will be the congress doesn t have the fire in its belly to fight the modi juggernaut.it is unlikely that priyanka gandhi could win varanasi if she were to contest. but she ll definitely give narendra modi a tough fight. at any rate a tougher fight than  say  the local congress favourite  ajay rai. priyanka gandhi can at best hope to bring down the margins. the contest will be one of margins. there is no reason why varanasi will want not want to be represented by the likely prime minister for a second term.yet the benefit of priyanka gandhi taking on narendra modi will be that this election will look like a contest after all. it will energise not just the congress but opposition forces across the country. the prevailing sense of an absent national opposition will change.also read  in maiden rally  priyanka gandhi vadra takes on pm modi on his home turfin the      lok sabha elections  the bjp put up smriti irani in amethi  against rahul gandhi. narendra modi went and campaigned there. the idea was to impact the national political narrative by suggesting that the bjp is so resurgent  it is willing to go and attack the congress on its home turf. that is also what the congress could achieve by taking on modi in varanasi.over a few weeks in varanasi  priyanka gandhi s campaign will help voters across india get a better chance to compare the two sides. it might even help us answer the tina question. is there really no alternative who s afraid of priyanka that is not to say that priyanka gandhi should or could come to be seen as a prime ministerial candidate. but at least a high profile pgv vs namo campaign will help the congress articulate its position better. at a time when the bjp has established a monopoly over the means of mass communication and political campaigning  priyanka gandhi in varanasi will help the congress hog the limelight  get saturation media coverage  and occupy people s minds.on    may  we should be ready to hear that priyanka gandhi too has flopped  because under her command the congress isn t about to see a revolution in central and east up. by contesting from varanasi  she can save her own career. she can establish her image as a politician at least willing to put up a fight.also read  priyanka gandhi vadra launches political career  but talk is all about indiraaap national convener and delhi chief minister arvind kejriwal may have lost varanasi in      but people there still remember what a challenge he had mounted.  the people of varanasi don t disappoint anyone. they are always welcoming of outsiders   a local journalist told me. varanasi is a city of possibilities. who knows the impossible may happen  it is a bjp stronghold all right  but the congress did win a surprise victory in the      lok sabha election.nominations can be filed between    and    april. varanasi votes on    may in the last phase. if the idea of priyanka gandhi contesting from varanasi is to lift the congress campaign nationally  then it is already late. two of seven phases are over. time is running out but the congress is never in a hurry. if not this election then the next one.suspense is not a bad thing  rahul gandhi says. it reminds one of former prime minister pv narasimha rao s famous line  that not taking a decision is also a decision. priyanka gandhi has made it clear she is up for it. but party president and dear brother rahul gandhi is hatching eggs on the idea.most likely  he will tell her to let modi win varanasi without any trouble. after all  rahul gandhi has the most to lose with the success of priyanka gandhi.the views are personal.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis   only you can

one ally that will help the new bjp or congress govt create jobs   artificial intelligence
text size  a  a this lok sabha election  nearly  .  crore first time voters are set to cast their ballots. and jobs are likely to be on the top of their minds.regardless of the political alliance that comes to power on    may  be it the bjp led nda or the congress led upa or a coalition  creating jobs for the educated youth should be the top priority for them.contrary to popular belief  one ally that new government shouldn t fear is artificial intelligence  ai . it can actually create millions of new jobs in india in the coming years  and most of them can be for non engineers.the three things that the new government must do to achieve this are stay out of the waythe narendra modi government loves acronyms  so here is my gift to them. soty   stay out of the way.let me explain this. ai s biggest impact will be on drastically reducing cost of doing business across several industries by raising efficiency.also read  modi   bjp have chosen not to counter congress s claims on jobs  and it

are created because more people can afford to buy these goods and services. for example  as smartphones became cheaper  millions of indians bought them and created hundreds of thousands of jobs for people selling and fixing them.the government s role here is to stay out of the way. if the government tries to slow down the pace of ai adoption across industries  because it might take away low paying manual labour jobs in the short term  or tries to create other regulatory hurdles  india will fall further behind in its quest for creating millions of jobs. take the short term pain for the long term gain.build india as a global ai hubthe easiest way to benefit from the ever increasing popularity of ai is to help establish india as the place where world comes for ai expertise.think of it as outsourcing for ai. the developed countries will lead in driving the usage of ai across all aspects of life  while india will likely follow the same route in the next      years if we look at the recent trends.indian it companies seized the opportunity that y k scare provided and built a multi billion industry that created a few million high paying jobs. similarly  new age tech companies of india  along with global tech giants  can help india become the place where ai for the world is built.conditions this time around are pretty much the same   there aren t enough engineers in the world but india has an excess of them  most of the world s programming still happens in english  and world s biggest tech companies already have business operations in india.what the government needs to do is  create a favourable policy environment  similar to what it did for the outsourcing bpo companies back in the late     s. tax benefits alone won t suffice this time. india will need a progressive

good news is that niti aayog seems to understand how important ai is for india  and the new pm would do well to listen to what technocrats at niti aayog are recommending. this will test the skills and the will of india s policymakers as it challenges their ability to take a short term hit for a long term gain. getting this right will create a whole new industry with high paying jobs for hundreds of thousands of people immediately  with positive domino effect to follow.use ai to reskill indiaone of the biggest issues that india s labour force faces is not having the right skills for the job. skill india had the right tagline  but it didn t go anywhere. the new government can take an ai driven approach to skilling by leaning on machine learning. there is no shortage of data in india. the

why bjp s startup push is better for indians looking for jobs than congress  nyay
text size  a  a a leaked national sample survey office report putting india s unemployment rate at a    year high in         allowed the opposition parties to blame the narendra modi government for not creating enough jobs in the last five years. the bjp argued back by saying that india s youth now have new avenues for jobs  which is reflected in the country s booming startup ecosystem  massive infrastructure development and record rise in exports.given the emerging complexity of the job scenario  the contradictions in various employment data become understandable. while the latest data from the employees  provident fund organisation  epfo  shows that new enrolments rose to a    month high  the much cited nsso data points towards the opposite direction. the near saturation of traditional employment sectors is an accepted fact. but what has largely gone undocumented is the rise of new innovation and technology driven jobs. current job surveys that focus on employment in the traditional sectors no longer provide an accurate representation of job creation   an ernst   young report   future of jobs in india  a      perspective   said while describing india s job landscape as being in a transition phase   saturation in core sectors and parallel emergence of  new engines of job creation . among the trends it recognises  two are particularly relevant  absorption of surplus farm labour into self employment micro entrepreneurship and emergence of new opportunities created through internet and technologies.also read  here s what we know for sure about jobs   unemployment under modi govtthe bjp government has pushed ahead on this technological front with initiatives like stand up india  startup india  mudra loan scheme and venture capital fund for scheduled castes to assist new entrepreneurs. it is because of these steps that india has emerged as the second largest start up ecosystem.on the other hand  the congress has in its manifesto for the      lok sabha elections promised rs       per month to    per cent people living below the poverty line and     days of work under national rural employment guarantee act  mgnrega . for a country that is poised to take the next big step  this is far from the desired push. where will the funds come to provide a teaming    crore people an annuity of rs         what work will be done in a village over     days  these are the questions that have been left to our imagination. to spend a major chunk of the budget on this scheme would require severe cost cutting in other spheres that will directly affect the middle and

difference. this is not to say that people are not earning their livelihood but that they are no longer doing so within the old parameters of employment. this shift has been enabled by widespread use of technology and creation of a knowledge economy and information society. in the past  state owned offices and private workplaces were essential job providers. this has changed now. with the altered dynamics of distance  information and networking  people can now earn their livelihood putting their talent and skills to use. we have decisively and irrevocably entered  gig economy  where entrepreneurship becomes a crucial factor.in the introduction to the  world development report       the changing nature of work   world bank president jim yong kim points out that  many children currently in primary school will work in jobs as adults that do not even exist today . this report makes us understand how the old yardstick of jobs has been rendered obsolete by the changed nature of employment. the report cites india as one of the countries where freelancing is booming. the number of freelancers in india is pegged at    million. it points out that a combination of innovation and technology is creating new types of jobs. among the  new  jobs that never existed two decades ago are app developers. according to the same world bank report  india has nearly   million app developers now and the country is also the second largest consumer of massive open online courses  moocs .another significant change comes in the form of platform based businesses that have revolutionised the traditional input output models. we now have systems where platforms such as flipkart and amazon bring together buyers  producers and providers. these changes put serious questions to the traditional parameters of jobs and taxation. moreover  the format where one person stayed in a job for decades is fast becoming redundant.also read  against modi govt s unemployment woes  next door china s

raj thackeray wants a modi mukt bharat  and is shooting from congress ncp shoulder
text size  a  a maharashtra s political circle seemed to be working overtime to establish the role of maharashtra navnirman sena chief raj thackeray  who earlier this month announced support to the alliance between the congress and the nationalist congress party in the lok sabha elections. by the end of last week  it had found in an old bollywood song a complete analogy for the thackeray gone rogue   begani shadi me abdulla deewana   which received endorsement by chief minister devendra fadnavis no less. raj thackeray s speeches targeting the party  but especially prime minister narendra modi  whom he had even mimicked to rapturous applause at a recent public gathering  have rankled the bjp quite a lot.but for someone whose party has no candidate in the fray  raj thackeray s eagerness to speak for the congress led alliance begs the question  why   because i want to build an india that is free of modi    or  in the pm s parlance  a  modi mukt bharat . thackeray says his maharashtra navnirman sena  mns  had worked in the last lok sabha elections for a  modi yukt bharat   but because modi has  backstabbed his supporters   he has decided to work towards ridding india of modi in     .but while the ever popular raj thackeray continues to draw impressive crowd at his gatherings  and wants to project his  modi mukt bharat  mission as genuine  some people are still annoyed with him.  what do we do with his speeches   a leader of the  secular  alliance  the congress  the ncp  a few smaller parties and at least one independent  told me.   his speeches  are more damaging to us than they are to modi  it is true that he is a skillful orator and his satires are sharp  but the historical trend suggests that while people gather in great numbers to hear him  they usually go and vote for others   the leader added.also read  the loneliness of raj thackeray   to ally or not  to contest elections or notthe alliance leader even takes a potshot at the mns  election symbol  rail engine.   raj thackeray s political position  is the reason why the mns s election symbol has no bogey attached to it. why should we extend our platform to a leader who doesn t enjoy a good political image  his image is also not good. some people call him political entertainer while others have labeled him a stand up comedian. the mockery and sneers hurled at raj thackeray forced me to take my query to another political leader   what is your issue with the mns chief s political speeches for lok sabha       is it worth openly mocking the inheritor of bal thackeray s legacy  the leader replied   what else do you expect from us  raj thackeray s mns is not contesting even a single seat this time. the party had lost all the seats it had contested in      lok sabha and assembly elections. some candidates won the corporation election by mistake but even they moved over to the shiv sena. now  raj and his rail engine are all alone. there is not a single coach attached to it. he could not find a single candidate to contest  the      general elections  on an mns ticket. after all  who wants to contest an election when even their deposits are not safe  several times we have told raj thackeray that navnirman  reconstruction  is not the way in politics.  dhan nirman   money making  is also important. we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowalso read  raj thackeray  .  is talking in hindi to north indians  courting sharad pawarthe leader elaborated   things have now gone overboard. his party is not contesting elections  yet his habit of making speeches forces him to open his mouth every now and then. he is in a great dilemma about what to do now. for him  not contesting elections is fine  but not giving speeches is unfathomable. even a proper sleep alludes him if he hasn t delivered a provocative speech or two. raj thackeray is paying a huge price to satisfy his desire for political speeches. it may cost him all that he possesses.at one time  raj thackeray used to be a proud shiv sainik  but his changed stance reduced his stature to a  sharad sainik   soldier of sharad pawar s army . there is a backstory to this  too. there was a time when raj thackeray used to rule the hearts of millions of shiv sainiks and nursed a grand ambition to be the uncontested leader of shiv sena. now  all that is a thing of the past. the great dynasty demon has corrupted indian politics in a big way and no political leader wants to share the spoils of power even within the extended family. raj thackrey is also a victim of this political tragedy. when he joined the shiv sena  every shiv sainik was enthralled. for them  he was goddess bhawani s blessing sent to inherit the illustrious legacy of his uncle  bal thackeray.his facial features were an exact match to his fiery uncle. in several ways  raj thackeray was a natural successor of bal thackeray and he tried to adopt whatever else he required to. he turned into an energetic leader and his oratorical skills had same satirical punch. he also started drawing cartoons  bal thackeray was a celebrated cartoonist of his time  but the younger thackeray forgot one important political reality  sometimes even a cartoonist turns into a cartoon. the mns chief learnt everything except bal thackeray s political astuteness  which was grasped by bal thackeray s son uddhav thackeray  the present shiv sena chief. it is not a matter of surprise that uddhav outwitted raj   after all  even the famous duo of modi shah has been forced to compromise with uddhav on his terms.also read  uddhav thackeray is the new hamlet in maharashtra politicshence  it is not surprising that raj thackeray  who was once a hero for the common shiv sainiks  is now a political zero. another bollywood song from raj kapoor s epic mera naam joker aptly summarises the current situation faced by raj thackrey  kabhi kabhi hero ko joker ban jana padta hai. for long  shiv sainiks as well as political observers had believed that raj thackeray would be the ultimate winner of political game of thrones inside shiv sena. and yet  he had to quit and was forced to launch the mns. in order to enhance his political acceptability  he also replaced the shiv sena s saffron flag with the mns  chequered one. secularism replaced hindutva for political ideology. raj rolled back shiv sena s strategy by four decades and aggressively adopted the stand of being pro marathi manus. he had to launch a vicious campaign against biharis and other north indians because common marathas could not identify with his bland no hindutva brand of politics.but all this could not deliver any electoral windfall.perhaps  the mns chief s desire to make a  modi mukt bharat  stems from the fact that modi supporters and bjp voters have already created a raj thackeray free maharashtra. today  the mns has no member in parliament or the legislative assembly. there were some corporates but they too went over to the shiv sena. so  what raj thackeray wants is revenge.but besides not being taken seriously enough  what is adding to his miseries is the election commission s foul mood. the poll panel has enquired about the expenses on his rallies. so many forces are attacking maharashtra s once indisputable hero  who  despite everything  hasn t given up yet. like the main protagonist of hindi film gully boy  raj thackeray continues to believe   apna time aayega

why indian courts shouldn t get their hopes up with congress promise of judicial reform
text size  a  a all the focus of the congress campaign has been on nyay for everyone in the      lok sabha election  but it is the party s manifesto promise on judicial reform that calls for scrutiny. with its nine point reform agenda  the congress has put the spotlight on india s judiciary that has needed urgent reform for quite some time now.nine point judicial reform agendathe congress       election manifesto has suggested nine important changes in the judiciary   from procedural to structural. these include  amending the constitution to make the supreme court a constitutional court  establishing court of appeals with benches at various locations  giving representation to women  scs  sts and obcs at various levels in the judiciary  fixing a common retirement age of    years for judges in tribunals  high courts  supreme court  introducing modern technology  ensuring technology for judges to track and expedite disposal of cases  appointing professionals for better roster and court management  establishing national judicial commission for the appointment of judges  and creating an independent judicial complaints commission.how important are some of these policies  a look at the datawhile the congress  manifesto lays down several promises  it is important to focus on certain crucial policies. let us analyse some of these proposed reforms through data.forming a constitutional court  limiting the powers of the supreme court for only constitutional matters has been advocated even in the past. the supreme court today is clogged with a variety of cases. a recent study by daksh pertaining to the cases handled by the supreme court in      shows that among the cases disposed  criminal matters  ordinary civil cases and service matters occupied the highest spot. ordinary civil cases tend to take nearly  .  years to get disposed while criminal matters take  .  years to get disposed. furthermore  data suggests that majority of the cases disposed in      were dismissed. hence  making the supreme court a constitutional court is the need of the hour.also read  failure on judicial reforms  front is one of narendra modi s biggest frustrationsestablishing court of appeals  daksh s      survey suggested that litigants spend on an average rs     per day to attend the court. also  the loss due to taking time off from work or business further came up to rs     per litigant. while the survey was carried out among the lower courts  the cost borne by the litigant to travel all the way to the supreme court would certainly be higher. hence  establishing a court of appeals in various locations would help reduce the overall cost for the litigants.representations in the judiciary  representation too is a serious concern. women representation is severely low. as per a recent study by vidhi centre for legal policy  only   .  per cent of judges in the subordinate courts are women   with states such as bihar and jharkhand having the lowest representation with   .  per cent and   .  per cent  respectively. addressing the under representation of women in the subordinate courts and the high courts is indispensable to achieving gender diversity within the judiciary.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowuse of technology  perhaps one of the most important reforms promised in the congress  manifesto deals with the integration of technology to track cases. under the e courts initiative  courts are entering the case related information online on a daily basis and these can be used by advocates and litigants to keep a track of their cases. even judges are greatly benefitted as they can use the data to monitor the progress of cases on their docket and focus on stages that are taking the most amount of time. data is a powerful tool that can play a pivotal role in reducing the pendency of cases in court. hence  technology should be used to its optimal level so that judges are able to constantly keep track of new and old cases and ensure their timely disposals.also read  scrutinising composition of judicial benches is a welcome barometercourt management  better court management is crucial to achieve speedy disposal of cases. listing optimal number of cases and ensuring that minimum adjournments are granted is essential. recently  a bench in the high court of karnataka listed close to     cases for five consecutive days  proving that there is a need to emphasise on better court management. the   th finance commission report stressed upon the requirement of having court managers. these mba qualified professionals are required to assist judges in identifying weaknesses in the court management systems and recommend workable steps. while court managers have been appointed in various states at the high court and the subordinate court level  research suggests that their skills haven t been utilised to the optimal level. for effective results  court managers need to be fully absorbed into the system.apart from the above mentioned reforms  the manifesto also promises to set up an independent commission for judicial complaints. who would be the part of this commission  to what extent would the commission be independent  these are the key questions that need to be addressed.will to implement the promisesas one of the most tumultuous five year periods for the judiciary in recent times comes to a close  it augurs well that there is finally some likelihood of a debate on reforming india s judicial system. but it would take more than just listing promises in a manifesto. for instance  indian courts have been wracked with pending cases that have only been on the rise over the years. as per the national judicial data grid  njdg   more than three crore cases are pending across the subordinate courts in the country. there is an immediate need to tackle the incoming case load and ensure that cases do not get lost in the judicial limbo. adequacy of judges and staff  proper infrastructure  better court management  and reducing pendency should be the real focus of the government round the clock.also read  congress promises to turn sc into constitutional court  set up court of appealsthe author is a research associate at

rahul gandhi s interest free education loan can t help much if banks are student unfriendly
text size  a  a as    million young indians in the age group of       get ready to cast vote for the first time in the coming weeks  the congress has tried to catch their attention with one of its poll promises dedicated solely to them  no bank interest on educational loans during the moratorium period  course period plus one more year . in a facebook post sunday  congress president rahul gandhi vowed to waive interests charged on educational loans until    march besides promising to create a one window system for such loans. this comes after the aam aadmi party s      promise on students higher education loans failed to take off.applying for a student loan in india is the classic case of low paying  entry level jobs requiring rich experience. as someone who has been through the ordeal  i can attest that the process is not only tedious but also dangerously discouraging for a student.it should be a matter of concern for a country with more than half its population under the age of     census        that conversations on or about students  educational loans rarely make news. the focus  if and when  remain confined to skill development  vocational training etc. the ordeals of a student who wants to study but lacks the means remain ignored.also read  what rahul gandhi missed out when he promised higher gdp expenditure on education  nyaycan a student secure a loan india s public sector banks  psbs  are the largest lenders in the education sector  disbursing over    per cent of all loans. but what are the chances of a student securing a loan without much hassle  take state bank of india s educational loan policy  for instance.to begin with  regular student loans for education in india are capped at rs    lakh and the bank s policy mandates a parent or a guardian to register as a co borrower. if a student s parents work in the informal sector  have a bad credit rating  or are without jobs  then the chances of getting the educational loan are next to impossible.students getting into premier colleges have it relatively easy than their regular counterparts with the sbi s scholar loan scheme relaxing the requirement while also keeping a bigger limit for the loan amount. however  the list of premier colleges is severely limiting and mostly covers engineering and management colleges. banks flatly refusing loans for courses in humanities or anything that is not engineering or an mba is fairly common. bank officials say the loan applications are assessed based on the  employability  factor associated with certain courses.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowit was only in march      that the narendra modi government notified the banks to increase the limit amount of loans that do not require a collateral or third party guarantee as security   from rs   lakh to rs  .  lakh. until then  the limit of rs   lakh played like a cruel joke on students  considering how unlikely it is that a private university offers a course under that limit. this cap was increased from rs   lakh only in march      since the average loan size remained at rs   lakh  possibly because a bulk of applicants did not have access to collateral or third party guaranteebut in case the institute revises the fee midway during the course  and the student has to move from the collateral fee category to another  then the ordeal in securing a guarantor while trying to finish the degree can be best left to imagination.also read  indian nurses are not paying back their education loansinterest waiversanyone who has successfully dealt with a public sector bank in their teenage years   possibly because their life depended on it   deserves a bravery award. walk into the disbursement section during the admission season and you will see students in tears because the bank managers sometimes turn into career counsellors holding a cheque.but only after completing the course does the real ordeal begin.banks charge interest during the entire period of study. and the interest rates for education loans remain one of the highest in the       per cent range. by the time the repayment begins  young graduates are drowned in debt. the congress promises to do away with the interest if it comes to power. but election promises are great conversation starters  they should be followed up with policies once the party is elected.the congress led upa government did partially waive interest on education loans for economically weaker sections in      but the plan announced in the interim budget. this partial waiver was only for households whose total income was less than rs  .  lakh per annum.one of the biggest problems with the educational loan structure is the notion that a student s higher education must be funded only by the family. so  a family household is identified for benefits like waivers and liability is shared by a parent as a co borrower. while this is generally regressive  it leaves women the most affected in a patriarchal society like ours.the scheme for interest waiver for other backward classes  obcs  and the economically backward classes  ebcs  taking loans to study abroad  ostensibly in the name of dr b.r. ambedkar  is on

reforms that could have beenrising npas even though the number of people eligible for higher studies is increasing manifold  banks are dragging their feet in disbursing student loans. to defend themselves  they often cite the rising non performing asset  npa  problem. rbi data shows that npa in education loans is indeed on the rise but a closer look at the numbers shows why this is not just a banking problem.for example  the highest number of npas in educational loans  at   .   per cent  comes from students who took up nursing course. fake degrees from unrecognised colleges are a widely acknowledged problem for courses in nursing  which perhaps explains the highest npas from this stream.the remedy  therefore  lies at looking at these problems and finding innovative solutions rather

bjp   congress manifestos offer a security policy high on emotions  low on substance
text size  a  a india is in the middle of an election campaign driven by the issue of  national security   especially as it comes after the pulwama attack and the balakot air strikes. so  there were a lot of expectations that the political manifestos of the congress and the bjp would refer to the issue with an improved mindset. but both parties  manifestos lack a holistic approach to national security  settling instead for a simple  to do  list which has been our bane in the past.the manifestos mirror what india s strategic community unanimously says  that india does not have a formal national security vision  that it lacks a coherent strategy  and that we go about managing national security affairs from  crisis to crisis .india needs radical reforms   with respect to higher defence management  integration of the three services  creation of the post of chief of defence staff  and restructuring  reorganisation of the armed forces. keeping in mind how modernisation of the armed forces has been at a virtual standstill for the last    years  here s a critical evaluation of the core issues that need to be addressed by india s political class.also read  bjp s last minute release of manifesto betrays its contempt for votershigher defence managementreforms in higher defence management are most critical because without a cohesive vision and strategy  the matter of national security remains rudderless. the congress proposes to provide statutory basis to the national security council  nsc  and the office of the national security adviser  nsa   define their powers and functions under the law  streamline their functioning  and make them accountable to parliament. it also proposes to make the national security advisory board a permanent statutory body to advise the nsc and the government. this is an urgently required reform.the bjp manifesto is conspicuously silent on the subject and has so far allowed these bodies to function in an ad hoc manner  concentrating power in the hands of the nsa.national security vision   strategyunfortunately  both manifestos remain silent on the urgent need for a strategic review to formulate a comprehensive national security strategy  which logically should be the basis of all strategic defence planning. the congress manifesto vaguely mentions that national security is dependent on a  sound defence policy  a sound foreign policy and sound leadership  without elaborating much on what this  sound  policy entails.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowthe bjp mentions   our security doctrine will be guided by our national security interest only. this is exemplified by the surgical strikes and the air strikes carried out recently.  it further talks about  zero tolerance  against terrorism and extremism  and continuing the policy of  giving a free hand  to the security forces in combating terrorism.also read  is bjp manifesto strong enough to make voters bring back narendra modi in may      both parties are silent on how to manage the security threats from our two potential adversaries  china and pakistan. this is inexplicable and wishing away the problem when  in the last two years  we nearly went to war with them.it is clear that neither the bjp nor the congress has any clue about the need for an all encompassing national security strategy  and so they are more focused on functional issues.tri service integrationthe congress specifically commits itself to establishing the office of the chief of defence staff  cds  and make the person holding the post the principal adviser to the government on all matters related to defence. the bjp is silent on this urgent reform and has so far made the nsa function as the ad hoc cds.both parties are silent on the related reform of creating tri service theatre commands. this is an inescapable reform and the call is political.force development strategyboth the congress and the bjp manifestos are similarly silent on the size of the defence forces and the need for reforms in structure organisation  which are needed to keep armed forces battle ready in the   st century.additionally  the manifestos also don t relate these reforms with the budgetary allocations that will likely become available in the subsequent years.also read  congress  election manifesto is the right document at the wrong time  yogendra yadavboth parties commit themselves to modernising the armed forces without specifying the percentage share of gross domestic product  gdp  they are willing to commit to the defence sector in the budget. the congress has specifically promised to reverse the trend of declining defence expenditure under the national democratic alliance  nda . it is well known that the current budget   at less than two per cent of the gdp   leaves little money for modernisation.both parties commit themselves to self reliance in defence equipment and creating the desired manufacturing capacity. while the congress talks in generic terms  the bjp is more specific with its  make in india in defence  programme.internal securityboth the bjp and the congress emphatically commit themselves to fighting terrorism in any form. however  both miserably fail to define the military and the political end state they are seeking.the congress promises to create the national counter terrorism centre within three months of coming to power and establish the national intelligence grid within six months.with respect to jammu and kashmir  the bjp indicates no change in its policy and promises to continue to look for peace through  decisive actions and firm policy . it promises to provide necessary funds for the state s development. the bjp reiterates its commitment to abrogate article     from the constitution and adds a new commitment to annul article   a. it promises to ensure the safe return of kashmiri pandits and provide financial assistance for the resettlement of refugees from west pakistan  pakistan occupied kashmir  pok  and chamb.the congress manifesto gives a more nuanced approach. it promises to uphold article     to preserve the special status to j k. it pledges an uncompromising firmness to deal with terrorists and end infiltration  an absolute fairness in dealing with the demands of the people  and winning the hearts and the minds of the local residents. it also promises to review the deployment of the armed forces to focus more on counter infiltration  reduce their presence in the hinterland  and give more responsibility to the jammu and kashmir police and the central armed police forces in the hinterland. it proposes to review the armed forces special powers act  afspa  and the disturbed areas act to balance the requirements of security forces and the protection of human rights. it promises to engage with all stakeholders through interlocutors.in a nutshell  the bjp promises to continue its  hard  policy  focusing on the military solution while the congress promises a people friendly counter insurgency campaign aimed at finding a political solution.the bjp manifesto  to say the least  is disappointing. it is ambiguous and shies away from disclosing the specifics. it is silent on strategic vision  national security reforms  defence budget  strategy with respect to potential adversaries  end state envisioned in jammu and kashmir northeast  and the action plan for modernisation of the armed forces. the congress manifesto  while marred by similar flaws   albeit to a lesser extent  in relative terms   is more positive  specific and action oriented.also read  what matters more to indian voters in elections  campaign slogans or party manifestos the two manifestos do not inspire any confidence. i foresee the continuity of a

few alliances that congress is stitching will also be undone by mahagathbandhan cracks
text size  a  a glued together by their visceral hate for prime minister narendra modi and constrained to fight for their own political survival  various opposition parties with no shared policy or ideology are trying to unite against the national democratic alliance by calling themselves  mahagathbandhan    a grand alliance. but the fragmented and leaderless alliance is a non starter.the congress party is supposed to be the nucleus of this grand alliance but other political parties are refusing to accept its leadership. moreover  not all political parties with significant presence at the state level have joined the mahagathbandhan. the net result is that the possibility of putting up one opposition candidate against the nda is proving to be more elusive than before.let s start with some of the biggest states   in terms of electorate   to look at where the congress  and the mahagathbandhan  stand just days before the elections.also read  at first up mahagathbandhan rally  muslims  jats  dalits share seats  set allies on their wayin uttar pradesh  where the samajwadi party  sp   the bahujan samaj party  bsp  and the rashtriya lok dal  rld  have joined hands to contest the lok sabha elections  the congress is nowhere in the scene. despite some initial talks in west bengal  the alliance between mamata banerjee s trinamool congress and rahul gandhi s congress seems unlikely with war of words between the leaders of the two parties continuing unabated. in delhi  the aam aadmi party  aap  will most likely not accept the congress  leadership  which makes any kind of alliance between them seem improbable.in kerala  the congress led united democratic front  udf  is pitted against the left democratic front  ldf . the fight between the left front and the congress has taken an ugly turn since the announcement that rahul gandhi will also be contesting from wayanad constituency  besides his traditional amethi seat in uttar pradesh   with the left accusing the congress of weakening the opposition s resolve to defeat narendra modi and his bharatiya janata party  bjp . similar is the case in odisha  andhra pradesh and telangana. the congress has also failed to enter into an alliance with the parliamentarian badruddin ajmal s all india united democratic front  aiudf  in assam.these eight states  which account for     seats in the lok sabha  will see a triangular or multi cornered contest making the mahagathbandhan irrelevant.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and

bharatthe congress  national party status has suffered a jolt in bihar where it has got only nine out of    seats to contest from while the alliance s principal partner  the rashtriya janata dal  rjd   will contest    seats with the remaining divided among smaller partners like upendra kushwaha s rashtriya lok samta party  five   jitan ram manjhi s hindustani awam morcha  three  and mukesh sahni s vikasshil insan party  three .out of    lok sabha seats in tamil nadu  the congress has got only nine seats  while it will contest from the single seat in puducherry. the national conference  nc  and the congress sealed an alliance for three lok sabha seats in jammu and kashmir and are talking of  friendly contests  on three other seats. in karnataka  the janata dal  secular   whose hd kumaraswamy is the state s chief minister  has bargained hard to get eight seats and the congress would be contesting on    seats.the few alliances that the congress has managed to cobble up will be undone by the cracks that have already appeared in mahagathbandhan. in jharkhand  for instance  the congress was allotted seven of the    parliamentary constituencies to contest from  with jharkhand mukti morcha  jmm  getting four  jharkhand vikas morcha  jvm  two and lalu prasad led rjd one. but the rjd later objected to the seat sharing and declared its candidate from chatra  which was allotted to the congress. state rjd president annapurna devi joined the bjp the day after the seat sharing agreement was finalised in jharkhand.also read  there are two ways opposition can beat modi in      and mahagathbandhan is not one of themin maharashtra  the congress is contesting    seats while the nationalist congress party  ncp  has managed to get    for itself. there is internal bickering in the congress with the party s state president ashok chavan sulking due to the alliance with the ncp.while there is a complete uncertainty about the so called mahagathbandhan  the nda already has the support of    political parties. the nda unity was reflected from the fact that it declared its bihar lok sabha candidates together. there was complete show of strength at bjp president amit shah s nomination filing at gandhinagar in gujarat. the bjp is contesting in punjab with shiromani akali dal  sad  and in maharashtra with the shiv sena. these two are decade old allies of the bjp.the grand alliance also does not have a pan india presence in comparison to the nda  with all its alliance partners rallying behind one leader   prime minister narendra modi. constituents of mahagathbandhan are likely to contest separately in many states  and would be engaged in  friendly fights   which is nothing but a euphemism for failure to arrive at any seat sharing agreement  in states like jammu and kashmir and jharkhand. the pompous mahagathbandhan is a farce and its bogey of anti modism is not going to last beyond this lok sabha elections.the author is national spokesperson of bjp.subscribe to

why priyanka gandhi can be bjp s best friend in      lok sabha elections
text size  a  a the congress is desperately trying to shoot itself in the foot. priyanka gandhi vadra s entry into politics and her ganga yatra from prayagraj to varanasi is but the latest example of that. it is true that her appointment as the congress s general secretary in charge of eastern up has enthused congress party workers. she has also drawn considerable crowds and is likely to garner a sizeable number of votes for the congress in uttar pradesh.however  the question worth pondering over is  does this serve the congress  principal objective  which is to prevent the bjp from returning to power after the      lok sabha elections  the obvious answer is no. a resurgent congress party in up  especially if the resurgence is likely to have limited impact  could  in fact  pave the way for pm narendra modi s victory. trend analyses and electoral arithmetic indicate that up  with its    lok sabha seats  will decide the fate of the modi government.priyanka gandhi s entry and the congress party s decision to contest most of the seats in up alone are more than likely to tilt the balance in the bjp s favour. these twin decisions will do so by cutting into the support for the sp bsp alliance in up  since the alliance and the congress have overlapping political bases in the state. given the disastrous performance of the yogi adityanath government in up and the impact of demonetisation  gst  unemployment  farmers  distress and deteriorating law and order situation on the voters  it was reasonable to expect that in the absence of the congress priyanka factor  the bjp s share of seats would have been cut to half to about    or   . the sp bsp combine was expected to pick up the remainder. priyanka gandhi s entry has put this calculation in grave jeopardy.also read  bjp has a poll strategy for priyanka gandhi   ignore herthe congress strategy seems to be aimed not so much at defeating the bjp as denying the sp bsp alliance victory in up as revenge for the latter s refusal to accommodate the congress in the alliance. had the congress been sincere about preventing the bjp s return to power and certain that priyanka gandhi s charisma would make a difference to the outcome in up  it would have put her up  in consultation with the sp bsp combine  as the opposition s joint candidate from varanasi while eschewing three cornered contests in the rest of up. this would have made the varanasi contest a high profile and high stakes fight with broader implications for the up elections without detracting from the sp bsp alliance s chances of attracting votes in the rest of the state.furthermore  it would have tied down prime minister modi to his constituency  thus reducing his capacity to campaign across the country for bjp candidates. the current scenario of three cornered contests in up  with the congress unlikely to gain more than a handful of seats  is tailor made for a bjp victory not only in the state but in the country as a whole.but this is not the end of the story. priyanka gandhi s appointment as congress general secretary has played into the bjp s hands by reinforcing the image that the congress is not only a dynastic party but also that the dynasty wants to maintain its control of the party well into the future since priyanka gandhi has children and rahul does not. priyanka gandhi s physical similarity to indira gandhi is also a mixed blessing. while it does endow her with some charisma  it also reminds the older generation of the excesses committed by indira gandhi  like the emergency. the subaltern castes and minorities in up bore the brunt of these excesses. they were also largely responsible for her humiliating defeat in the      lok sabha elections. it is  therefore  imprudent to believe that everyone is enamoured by priyanka gandhi s resemblance to her grandmother. it could cut both ways.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowpriyanka gandhi also carries a great deal of negative baggage in the form of her husband robert vadra because of his alleged involvement in land scams. whether proven or not  most people believe that vadra has been involved in shady deals and thus amassed ill gotten wealth. now that she has entered politics  vadra s negative image has made priyanka gandhi fair game for her husband s detractors. this has further played into the hands of the bjp s troll army  whose primary goal is to demean the gandhi family and the congress party.also read  priyanka gandhi can be to congress what sunil gavaskar was for india in west indiesa footnote  rahul gandhi s decision to contest from wayanad in kerala also defies political rationality. if he needed to stand for a second seat in the south he should have chosen a constituency in karnataka that would have pitted him directly against a bjp candidate. standing against the left front in kerala sends the wrong message for several reasons.one  it denotes that he is too afraid to take on the bjp even in a southern constituency. two  it signals that he is looking for a safe seat because he is apprehensive that he will lose amethi to bjp s smriti irani. three  although the congress led udf is pitted against the left front in kerala  inducting a heavyweight outsider like rahul gandhi into the battle is an unwarranted slap on the left s face. this is especially unwise since the congress will need the left parties as allies to form a government in new delhi in case the bjp led nda falls short of a majority.also read  modi created india s north south divide  rahul gandhi contesting from wayanad will unite themtaken together all these decisions signal that there is a serious lack of strategic thinking within the congress leadership. this shortfall could bring the bjp back to power in new delhi  thus subverting the congress party s

modi   bjp have chosen not to counter congress s claims on jobs  and it s the right strategy
text size  a  a in the run up to the lok sabha elections  the congress and its leader rahul gandhi have repeatedly raised the issue of unemployment and accused the narendra modi government of failing to provide jobs.one would normally expect the bjp to counter it by reading out a long list of economic achievements of the modi government in the last five years.but the bjp has chosen not to do that. its election strategy team knows well that showcasing  good economics  hardly translates into more votes.     defeatin       the bharatiya janata party  bjp  suffered a stunning defeat in the lok sabha elections despite delivering on growth and economic progress.so  what went wrong for the bjp in      the bjp s campaign managers  in their bid to showcase a  shining india   did not talk about

why in       the focus of the bjp campaign is not showcasing the gdp numbers or boasting about macroeconomic fundamentals.it is rather projecting people s schemes  like ujjwala or mudra  and telling voters about the significant changes the modi government has brought in their everyday lives.the bjp s campaign managers know that elections are all about influencing voters  in urban and rural areas

an eminent lawyer activist put this question to a psephologist turned political activist on a winter evening in early     . they were part of the aam aadmi party  aap  then and were coming to terms with the realisation that kejriwal was just another politician who was determined to go to any extent in his pursuit of power. if it has to be only one of the two  i guess  kejriwal   replied the psephologist after pondering for a while. he himself was surprised by this conclusion.  then  what are we doing here  in the aap    asked the lawyer. kejriwal resolved their dilemma soon  expelling them from the party.a lot of water has flown under the old yamuna bridge since then. the two former aap leaders may be thinking about the irony of that discussion in today s context. but they must

least three reasons.first  the two parties together could easily vanquish the bjp in the national capital that sends seven members to the lok sabha. the bjp clinched all seven seats in      when the aap and the congress contested separately. well ensconced in delhi where the erstwhile ruling party  the congress  is still struggling to get its act together  the aap considers narendra modi led bjp

including the rajouri garden bypoll and the municipal election losses.second  if the aap manages to extend this alliance to haryana or punjab  it would give the party a fresh lease of life in punjab where it is witnessing a massive slide and help it expand its footprints in the neighbouring state.third  an alliance with the congress could give kejriwal a place at the political high table in the event of a non bjp coalition forming government post polls. you can t miss the pride and glee on kejriwal s face whenever he is standing shoulder to shoulder with the top leaders of the country during shows of opposition strength. it does not matter any longer that he berated them for their alleged acts of omissions and commissions until recently. he always had national ambitions and they are soaring again.a potentially suicidal actit s not uncommon in politics that the option that looks the easiest and the most gainful turns out to be the most treacherous. an alliance with the congress would surely give a fillip to the aap in the immediate future. but  it could also turn out to be a suicidal decision for the aap in the long run.also read  remember arvind kejriwal  here s how aap lost the national plotkejriwal may believe that like many parties that had their genesis in anti congressism and yet shook hands with the congress at some point in time  the aap too wouldn t suffer from this tactical shaking of hands with its b te noire. in this case  the congress would be compelled to play second fiddle to the aap in delhi as it does in up and bihar for survival but projects it as a move aimed at defeating communal forces.or  kejriwal may believe that the congress  decline in delhi as in other parts of the country is so inexorable that it doesn t matter in the long run.kejriwal may be hugely mistaken on both counts. and it s not because the congress under rahul gandhi is not prepared to play second fiddle any more.it s also not because the congress is not showing any signs of rising from the ashes like a phoenix. it s because kejriwal is in a self destruct mode and that has given the congress the courage to risk shaking hands with him.kejriwal isn t like the children of  total revolution   such as lalu prasad yadav in bihar  who have had long and distinguished political careers. jayaprakash narayan s movement brought leaders such as lalu  mulayam singh yadav and nitish kumar to the political forefront. but they could not have become what they became without the mandal kamandal politics that destroyed the congress party s traditional vote bank in the hindi heartland and beyond.the congress hasn t suffered any such permanent ruptures in its vote bank in delhi. the anna hazare movement did bring kejriwal to the political forefront  but he has wasted the opportunity  all the time looking for excuses for his non performance and driving out the best from the party with his vainglorious and supercilious attitude.tired of politicians whom they saw using caste  religion and money to grab power  the common man saw hope in an anti corruption crusader who had quit the civil services to fight against the system. the same people now see him showcasing his  bania  credentials in delhi and haryana  defending his tainted colleagues and rubbing shoulders with dyed in the wool politicians. the man who became a leader by riding public sentiments for anna s jan lokpal bill was hardly agitated over the modi government not appointing a lokpal until the judiciary intervened.also read  arvind kejriwal should know bhagwant mann quitting alcohol is not a sacrifice for punjabin january       kejriwal had released  india s most corrupt  list and exhorted party members to defeat those who figured on it. in the run up to the      election  kejriwal was rushing to sharad pawar s residence to seek his intervention for an alliance with rahul gandhi s party. pawar had figured on the      list.with kejriwal already going back on everything he and his party stood for in public life  an alliance with the congress is all that the aap needs to formally declare the moral death of a party that once challenged the  system . but would you shed

in karnataka  bjp wins lok sabha   congress  jd s  state polls but      can be a close fight
text size  a  a a year ago  as a fierce battle for the state assembly unfolded  karnataka was the lodestar for indian political observers to assess the mood of the nation. a year later  as the lok sabha elections draw near  karnataka merely offers two questions and a regret.let s begin with the two questions.first  will the bjp maintain the political dominance it has had in karnataka in the last three lok sabha elections  called the  bjp s gateway to south india   karnataka has given to bjp        and    seats out of    in            and      respectively. note that the bjp did well in karnataka even when the upa had significant success elsewhere.in       the bjp and lok shakti  splinter janata dal group led by ramakrishna hegde  had secured    seats.also read  math done  now congress jd s  has to pass chemistry test in karnatakahowever  the bjp s dominant performance in the lok sabha elections in these two decades has not translated to success in the assembly elections. conversely  despite their significant political clout  congress and janata dal  secular  have not managed to prevent the bjp s electoral dominance in lok sabha elections  with the exception of       when congress won    seats.what explains the bjp s consistent success in karnataka during the lok sabha elections we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowinterestingly  karnataka has always voted in favour of one national party  regardless of the national political mood or political reality in the state.in the first    lok sabha elections until       the congress consistently secured three fourths of karnataka s lok sabha seats. in       buoyed by h.d. deve gowda s leadership  the jd s  won    seats  breaking the congress stronghold over karnataka. deve gowda went on to become the prime minister. as noted above  from      onward  the bjp s ascendance began.a potent alliance of  largely urban  middle classes and lingayats constitute the core support base for the bjp. add to this mix a select group of obcs such as nayakas and balijas  who are numerically large and resourceful  as well as scheduled castes such as bhovi  vaddar . while these groups have consistently supported the bjp during state assembly elections as well  intense competition  as well as local political factors  have prevented the bjp from achieving state level political dominance  which it has done in gujarat and madhya pradesh.apart from this social coalition  karnataka s voters have found the bjp s nationalism more appealing  especially in lok sabha elections. this factor alone has provided the much needed edge for the bjp in the last two decades. in       pm narendra modi s leadership aura may well constitute an attraction. however  note that in       the bjp under modi won two less seats compared to      when it had secured    seats.will the bjp electoral juggernaut roll on in karnataka  the answer will depend on the response to our second question  how will the congress jd s  coalition perform in a national election also read  karnataka raids a brazen display of power  undermine democracypolitical expediency  and specifically deve gowda s fierce anti bjp stance  were clearly at the heart of the congress jd s  alliance when it came to power in may     . note that the congress and the janata parivar  in all its various avatars  have been historically political rivals for over four decades now. this is particularly true in southern karnataka  where that fierce rivalry at the local level threatens the viability of the alliance itself. therefore  it is no surprise that the h.d. kumaraswamy government has had its share of challenges and its future may very well depend on the lok sabha election results. winning a majority of seats would ensure its survival for the foreseeable future and that is an incentive for kumaraswamy.conversely  the bjp and jd s  have always complemented each other across the state. this stands to reason since the bjp has banked on lingayat support in north and central karnataka for its rise whereas jd s  has had the vokkaligas of southern karnataka as its main constituency. political whispers in delhi and bengaluru indicate that but for deve gowda s steadfast opposition  the ever pragmatic kumaraswamy would have already been in the nda camp by now  that he isn t  is not for the lack of trying on the bjp s part. it is also significant that in the past    years  the bjp has accommodated a significant number of janata parivar leaders in central  north and urban karnataka.given this political reality  will the congress and the jd s  succeed in transferring their votes to their combined candidates  speaking at a joint congress jd s  rally in the outskirts of bengaluru sunday  rahul gandhi appealed to his party men to work together with the jd s . will they follow his lead  this factor alone will determine the election results in nearly half of the lok sabha constituencies of southern and central karnataka. in coastal and north karnataka regions  jd s  has always had a marginal presence and much of its lingayat leadership has already moved to the bjp.seat sharing arrangements have been made  candidates have been selected and campaigning has begun. three weeks before polling  the bjp seems to have an edge in    seats and the congress jd s  alliance in the remaining   . given the veteran leadership in both sides and their ability to manage the elections quite astutely  this could be a closely fought election.also read  congress  jd s  put up united front   a message more for cadre than oppositionfinally  my regret about the      lok sabha elections. karnataka presents no signs of giving birth to an alternative politics. this is disappointing at two levels. first  karnataka has historically produced remarkable social movements and significant civic activism. in recent years  bengaluru has begun to generate new forms of citizen engagement with public issues and platforms like bangalore political action committee  bpac   which have been actively trying to produce a responsible and responsive political class. additionally  bengaluru s demography has also changed dramatically in the last two decades  making it fertile ground for an aap like new political force. swaraj abhiyan  with some roots in farmers and dalit movements  makes some noise in the media but it just cannot compete. it is extremely disappointing that all this civic activism hasn t produced any political capital and politics continue as usual.second  consider the candidates fielded by the bjp and the congress jd s  alliance. not only are they all conventional politicians  but a majority of them are from political dynasties. in       nandan nilekani  v. balakrishnan  former infosys cfo  and k. arkesh  retired igp  crpf  found themselves in the electoral arena. nilekani was even fielded by the congress. no such luck this time. such a lack of credible new faces is another source of deep

modi created india s north south divide  rahul gandhi contesting from wayanad will unite them
text size  a  a the news that congress president rahul gandhi will contest as a candidate from the wayanad lok sabha constituency in kerala was decried by his political rivals. they tried to make a case that rahul gandhi was running away from his traditional stronghold of amethi in uttar pradesh and or was going against the opposition unity  which the congress has often spoken about  by taking on the left in kerala. but the reality is that rahul gandhi has simply taken another step towards further sealing his credibility as a prime ministerial candidate who is ready for national leadership.for one  rahul gandhi s decision comes at a time of unprecedented assault on the spirit of cooperative federalism that has held the country together since its independence in     . under the bjp led nda government at the centre  relations between the southern states and the federal government have steadily deteriorated. this was partly because of cultural factors such as the modi government s drive to impose hindi across the southern regionor the attempts to ban beef  which is widely consumed in the south. but there have also been larger issues in recent times that threaten the economic security of the southern states as well as the future of the region s political representation in new delhi.the bjp government s decision in may      to change the terms of reference in the   th finance commission and use the      census figures as the benchmark for revenue sharing among the states  as opposed to the      figures that were used in the previous finance commissions  had a particularly vitiating effect.also read  modi govt has nothing to show in kerala  and so rss made me part of its attack agendathe southern states were understandably aggrieved since it meant that their share in the revenue raised by the centre would be slashed while that of their northern counterparts  where the population has steadily grown  would go up. at the same time  this also has implications on the   st amendment to the constitution through which the atal bihari vajpayee government  in       froze the allocation of lok sabha seats for    years to encourage population control  by assuring states that success in limiting population would not lose them lok sabha seats. this is the carefully balanced arrangement that the modi government so carelessly disregarded by instructing the finance commission to use the      census figures instead of the      figures  causing uproar among the southern states.it is in this context that rahul gandhi has made a bold statement of intent to suggest that he can be the bridge that repairs this growing north south divide within the country. it also signals that he has the confidence to win elections in both the north and the south. can narendra modi make such a claim  would he have the courage to fight for a seat in kerala if rahul gandhi wins  and there is little to suggest otherwise  from both amethi and wayanad  he will be one of the rare leaders in the country who enjoys a clear and demonstrated popularity in both the south and the north. and  most importantly  the south will be galvanised by the fact that its concerns are unlikely to be ignored by such a leader  one who will walk into parliament on the back of their support. in his own words  the congress president has sent out a clear message of reassurance   south india feels hostility from narendra modi  i wanted to send  the  message  that i am standing with you .we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowalso read  nda s answer to rahul gandhi in wayanad is a powerful obc leader   liquor baronthere is certainly precedent too. in       former prime minister indira gandhi contested from both rae bareli in uttar pradesh and chikmagalur in karnataka  and in      she added medak  now in telangana  to the list . in       sonia gandhi jointly launched her campaign in both amethi and bellary in karnataka.it is a bit rich for the bjp to suggest that rahul is running away from a supposed stiff fight in amethi  considering that his main rival there has been unable to muster a win in a popular election in the entirety of her    years in indian politics. it is also clear that they are consciously choosing to ignore the precedents of their own stalwarts  from atal bihari vajpayee  who contested from three constituencies in uttar pradesh in        lucknow  mathura and balrampur  and managed to only win balrampur  to l.k. advani  who contested from new delhi and gandhinagar in      and won both  or for that matter the current prime minister narendra modi  who contested from vadodara and varanasi in       winning both .by demonstrating his electability in the south  as party president  rahul gandhi is also reiterating and publicly demonstrating the congress  age old commitment to being a party that stands for an inclusive india. the congress  idea of india is that of an india where all indians matter   unlike the present ruling dispensation  which has made it clear through their actions that some indians come first and others are beyond their comprehension. by choosing to fight from a constituency that shares a border with tamil nadu and karnataka  rahul gandhi s wayanad move is also a strategic decision to energise the congress in the south and help it build serious momentum in this part of the country in the run up to the general elections  scheduled in a week from now.also read  not just a  safe seat  for rahul gandhi  congress sees wayanad as key to its southern revivalthe issue of sending the wrong signal by challenging the left is a bit curious. in kerala  the left and the congress are sworn adversaries and have fought bitter elections against each other for decades. that hasn t prevented the left from participating in post poll support to the upa   in      for instance after it routed the congress in the lok sabha elections in the state. there is no good reason why contesting against each other should prove an impediment now. after all  post poll calculations are always different from pre poll ones. at the national level  the left has fewer differences with the congress than it has with the bjp  and it makes sense for the left  with its modest numbers  to support a secular party committed to social justice if it is in a position to stop the bjp.in other words  there are no valid objections to rahul gandhi s decision to contest in kerala. it looks like a win win from all angles   a phrase that will recur when the results are in from amethi and wayanad on    may.dr shashi tharoor is a member of parliament

fundamentally weak and unravelling the congress manifesto has a section on cities  which promises the introduction of  a new model of governance for towns and cities through a directly elected mayor with a fixed term of   years  an elected council and a separate administrative structure for each urban body.  it further states that the city administration  will be accountable to the mayor and the council and there will be a provision to recruit technical experts and build capacity as well as multi disciplinary teams to do urban planning and implement municipal works. also read  congress  election manifesto is the right document at the wrong time  yogendra yadavfocus on citiesthe renewed push on cities and urban governance is a welcome change. the idioms that dominate indian politics continue to be centred on the village since more than two thirds of the country is still rural. urban india is vastly underrepresented in parliament and has a lower share of representatives than what its population warrants. hence  issues of urban governance rarely get enough political and policy attention.while politicians like shashi tharoor and milind deora have flagged the need for directly elected mayors in the past  it never got wide traction. while rajiv gandhi brought the agenda of panchayati raj at the forefront of indian politics  rahul gandhi could do the same for urban governance.however  the proposal of introducing directly elected mayors also raises some difficult questions.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowthe constitutional questioncurrently  the process of electing a city s mayor and his her tenure in office varies vastly across india. while bengaluru has an indirect election for the mayor with a tenure of one year  mumbai has indirect elections for a  .  year tenure and bhopal has a directly elected mayor for a term of five years. this is because each state s municipal laws determine the details of the office of the mayor. while the   th constitutional amendment passed in      lays out the broad outline of how municipalities should function  it has not prescribed the mode of election or tenure of mayors.hence  the primary question to examine is whether the centre can introduce a uniform system of directly elected mayors with a fixed five year term for all cities across india. as per item no.    list ii of the seventh schedule of the constitution   local government  is a state subject. hence  the centre cannot legislate on issues related to local government or dictate how mayors of municipalities are elected.also read     fastest growing global cities in india  economic boom or poor focus on quality of life if this reform is to be made mandatory across all states  the centre would have to introduce a constitutional amendment  as congress mp shashi tharoor attempted in a private member s bill . this is not only a cumbersome process that requires a    rd majority in parliament and endorsement from half of the states  but it also raises concerns regarding over prescribing and centralising local government rules.alternatively  if the centre tries to entice states to pass this measure by making it a conditionality for receiving central funds  it would betray the spirit  if not the letter  of the   th amendment. what congress can instead do is introduce mayoral reforms first in the states that it governs and then demonstrate its effectiveness so that other states can pick up.urban governance reformsbeyond the question of how such a reform can be introduced  the more fundamental question is whether it can positively impact india s cities.the global examples of directly elected mayors successfully transforming their cities have little relevance for india. in indian cities  it is not just the mayor who is weak  but also the municipality.instead of a city government that performs all the key urban tasks  we have urban local bodies  ulbs   which are often just one among different agencies responsible for the city s administration. the ulb is politically  financially and administratively weak and heavily reliant on the state government for its functioning.the mayor  whether directly or indirectly elected  has a limited sphere of influence in indian cities currently. to address this issue  merely changing the mode of election or tenure of the mayor is not enough. after all  towns and cities in states like uttar pradesh  madhya pradesh  bihar  jharkhand  etc.  have directly elected mayors with fixed five year terms  but few would argue that they are better administered.only if mayoral reforms are accompanied by other measures that empower urban local governments would there be any meaningful change in city governance. however  beyond the mention of hiring multidisciplinary specialists and experts  the congress manifesto has not clearly committed for a broader agenda of urban governance reform. the congress proposal should hopefully initiate a wider discussion among local  state and central governments and the public at large regarding what urban governance systems we need and what are the ways of instituting it.also read    things congress must explain before

  things congress must explain before india s poor believe in its minimum income support
text size  a  a the congress on    march      announced a minimum income guarantee programme that promises to give up to rs        a year or rs       a month to    per cent of india s poorest families if voted back to power. while ambitious  a policy such as nyuntam aay yojana  nyay  requires some careful thinking and analysis.minimum income support is a sign of development. developed countries all over the world have some form of basic income support for their citizens. the united kingdom has job seeker s allowance  which provides minimum income support   between        and          if the person couple is aged    and above. the united states has a welfare or temporary assistance for needy families  tanf  that provides cash for a limited time to low income families working towards self sufficiency. besides looking into whether or not such policies are feasible for a country like india  what needs to be also ascertained is how robust are the soundness of the policy announced by rahul gandhi.also read  rahul gandhi s nyay raises too many questions   is not the answer to ending povertyhouseholds in the poorest    per cent of income distribution earn more than rs        per year.the congress promising rs        a year to the poorest    per cent of indian households raises doubts on the underlying assumption to arrive at the number. this proposal assumes that    per cent of indian households are earning less than rs       per month. while there is no credible income distribution data in india  the centre for monitoring indian economy  cmie  s consumer pyramid data delivers record level data of a large household survey conducted in india. the sample size was          households during        . this is a panel of households with an objective of building longitudinal data series based on regular surveys.the survey captures data on household demographics  which include member wise characteristics  household amenities such as water and electricity  household income and expenses  and household assets and borrowing by households. using the cmie sample survey data  it is estimated that the average income of the lowest    per cent household group is rs       . only the bottom   per cent of the sample households earn less than rs        annually.also read  nyay is product of same meena kumari politics that brought congress to    in      from    households belonging to the poorest    per cent of income distribution essentially belong to the informal economy.the government  should it come to that  would need some mechanism to filter out households that earn less than rs        a month. that would be difficult because neither do these households pay any taxes  since they fall below the taxable income threshold  nor are they on any payroll database.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowmost households in the poorest    per cent category get their monthly income in cash without anything to show as proof of income. how then does the government distinguish between those genuinely earning below rs        per month and those who are just  lemons  would be a matter of great concern. in such a scenario  unless the employer confirms the earning  which in itself is an avoidable cost for the employer   there will be a rise in number of households wrongfully claiming to earn less than rs        a month. this will not only burden the government but also give rise to corruption. in short  the minimum income support will not be feasible in india as long as we have a large population working in the informal sector.also read  with cash transfers  both bjp and congress are showing no imagination in fighting povertywhat is the incentive of earning or even working social security programmes all over the world are criticised mostly for disincentivising an individual or having adverse consequences than intended. while the promise to pay or make the income reach up to rs        a month is ambitious  it comes with its own disadvantages. a person earning rs       a month may have no incentive to work and earn even that amount as he she is better off not working at all and getting the entire sum of rs        from the government. econ     suggests that when you provide direct income support  a large number of households go out of the labour force for lack of incentive to work. in such a case  the congress might be better off providing either a temporary support scheme like tanf in the us which provides support until the family reaches a sustainable level or laying down certain per conditions for support  e.g.  minimum number of days worked etc.while the intent of the congress is applauded  such a policy needs to be well thought through not only because it has economic implications but also fiscal implications. it is estimated that such a programme is likely to cost rs  .  lakh crore per annum to the government. such a policy could be financed either by raising more taxes or cutting down on fiscal expenditure on productive investments or rationalising subsidies. india s tax to gdp ratiois already expected to reach    per cent. with very little room for raising taxes any further  it seems doubtful whether indian tax payers  with their increasing scrutiny of the government  would like to see their hard earned money be used in such a helicopter drop manner.the author is a research fellow at national institute of

modi or rahul gandhi  a guide on how to choose whom to vote for
text size  a  a what is remarkable about the      lok sabha election is that the very nature of the contest is under contest.on the face of it  the bjp is asking people to give narendra modi a second term as prime minister  while the congress and other opposition parties are campaigning to topple him. yet below the surface  the bjp is essentially running a presidential campaign in a parliamentary election  as if the lok sabha were an electoral college that will place narendra modi in the chief executive s seat. this is not surprising. having run a nearly presidential government for the past five years  modi quite likely wants to continue in the same fashion.if the bjp wins again india is quite likely to have a government that is parliamentary in form  but presidential in substance. this would be quite a radical departure from the constitutional scheme that sees the prime minister as the first among equals.also read  the presidential prime minister narendra modiunlike what many people have come to believe  members of the council of ministers  the cabinet  have complete authority over the ministries they head. the prime minister is the head of the council of ministers and chooses his or her cabinet colleagues  but the council as a whole is collectively responsible to the lok sabha. while some prime ministers  like jawaharlal nehru  indira gandhi and narendra modi  have dominated their cabinets  the constitution does not envisage an all powerful pmo that directs individual ministries on policy matters.the relationship between the prime minister and his or her cabinet colleagues is not one where the latter are subordinates. modi changed this in practice once he became the prime minister in     . the bjp s election campaign promises the voter more of this should the party return to power.it is  therefore  just as well that the congress and other parties opposed to the bjp are not offering their own presidential candidate. partly by design and partly due to circumstances  the fact that the opposition is not putting forth a strong  unequivocal prime ministerial candidate ensures that the election remains parliamentary  as it is meant to be.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowwhile the election rhetoric might suggest that this is a referendum on modi as the bjp would have it  or a manifesto for a new welfare state that the congress promises  the deeper choice is one between majoritarianism and redistribution. you can t compare apples and oranges  but as voters  we ll still have to choose between them. how will either of them tackle the smog of resentment  grievance and anxiety that has settled on the country over the past few years  how will either of them generate economic growth  majoritarianism without growth will devour its own  while redistribution without growth will drive us to ruin. days before the elections  we have no idea what the bjp  congress and the others will do to restore economic growth.also read  narendra modi and jobs  it s all about data  and how it s calculatedindia s biggest short  medium and long term challenge concerns jobs. the real scandal is not the lack of jobs data  but the lack of jobs. the required run rate is    million jobs per year  our best and current run rate is   million per year. in other words  we need a ten fold jump in job creation. that is the only way we can address rural distress  by getting surplus rural labour out of agriculture   urban underemployment and provide meaningful occupations to the millions of people entering adulthood every year.this is a challenge that is unprecedented in scale and scope and missing from the electoral debates. we are offered more nationalism and more redistribution  neither of which is a way to generate massive employment. we are like a patient who needs to select a surgeon to carry out a complicated operation  being asked to choose between a good looking doctor and a guitar playing one.also read  why voters don t turn up in larger numbers in lok sabha elections   all politics is localit is both lazy and irresponsible to conclude that all options are equally bad  so let s just vote  none of the above . that would be a cop out. it could also put in place a government worse than we might have willfully chosen.there is a local dimension to our political choices  in fact  it is on this that we actually exercise our franchise. sending the best person  or the least worst person  on the ballot to the lok sabha is an important and useful thing to do  in itself.ultimately  there is also a moral dimension to our political choices  and it has an important role to play at these times.the article was written before the congress published its manifesto.the author is the director of the takshashila institution  an

there are very few bjp strongholds or congress bastions in india. data shows why
text size  a  a an important ongoing discussion in some political circles in india is whether the election commission should limit public access to the so called form    data  which reports the exact number of votes that each candidate receives in each polling booth in an election. the form    data has been made available for the      and the      general elections  and also for the state elections held in recent years.the main reason offered by those who want to limit access to this data is that it is an important democratic principle that the vote is kept secret  and if the data reveals that most voters in a polling booth vote for the same party  it is no longer so secret how someone votes.this knowledge is important because it might allow powerful people to control the vote in a polling booth  undermining the freedom of the vote.the underlying assumption these individuals are making is that there are many areas across the country where certain political parties wield significant control. in other words  parties have many strongholds  which deliver overwhelming votes in their favour  election after election.however  a look at the polling booth level data reveals that this assumption is incorrect.also read  it s a myth that      election was exceptional in the vote share of winning candidateswe are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust

competition for votes in most polling stations. second  there are very few polling stations that voted overwhelmingly for the same party in the      and the      lok sabha elections. third  even at the polling booth level  there is an enormous swing in the vote share of different parties from one election to the next.in other words  even with access to the form    data  it is virtually impossible to know how people vote.figure   shows polling booth level data for approximately  .   lakh villages and towns across    states for      and      elections.we report the  largest  vote share for each polling booth and not the  winning  vote share because no candidate really wins a polling booth. victory or losses are at the parliamentary constituency level.in       the average largest vote share in a locality was just below    per cent  in       it was just over    per cent. in both      and       there were some villages and towns where the largest vote share obtained by any party was as low as    per cent whereas it soared to     per cent in a few places. however  in the vast majority of localities  about    per cent   the largest vote share was between    per cent and    per cent. this means that in most places the vote is so fragmented that it is impossible to know how any individual voted.figure    the largest vote share for any party in  .   lakh villages and towns in    indian statesfew local level strongholdsthese data should raise concern about claims that indian elections have electoral strongholds.we can see in figure   that it is uncommon for any one party to get a large share of the votes in any place. however  to put another nail in the electoral stronghold coffin  we assess what happens to the vote share of parties across both the elections  for a party to really have an electoral stronghold  it should get a large share of the votes in that particular area over at least two consecutive elections.also read  political parties dominate

across the      and      elections.the same party was able to capture more than    per cent of the votes in about a quarter of the localities in the data. this percentage shrinks rapidly when we examine higher vote shares. only about one in    villages or towns supported the same party with more than    per cent of the votes across the two elections  and in less than four per cent of the localities was the same party able to capture more than    per cent of the votes across both elections.from these data  it is quite clear that there are very few local level strongholds in indian elections. the fact that one often hears about party strongholds is perhaps a result of a marketing ploy by local politicians to try to attract more voters to their preferred party or to extract resources from candidates running for the election.table    local level vote share for the winning parties in             and across both electionselectoral volatilitynot only are there almost no strongholds at the local level in indian elections  but there is also enormous volatility  an idea similar to vote swing  from one election to the next. electoral volatility can be understood as the absolute change in the vote share of each party from one election to the next  divided by two.if each party gets the same number of votes across elections  the electoral volatility is zero. if all parties competing in a constituency are new  i.e. the old parties get no votes   then there is a     per cent swing away from the old parties and a     per cent swing to the new parties  making the electoral volatility    . if there are two parties in a constituency and one party s vote share falls from    per cent to    per cent and the other party s vote share increases from    per cent to    per cent  the total electoral volatility is     the change in vote share of both parties divided by two .countries in western europe  which generally have a smaller population and a long democratic

nyay is product of same meena kumari politics that brought congress to    in      from    
text size  a  a some congress people are using this    june      national interest to counter my doubts over nyay. they should read it again.warning  it told them two years ahead that this self pitying povertarianism will bring them below three figures in     . and i had still under estimated. they ended up with   .the electoral politics of the last two years has made one thing clear  you no longer win elections in india by reminding people how awfully rotten their fate is. particularly when you are an incumbent and your party has been governing them most of the time.this young  aware india is aspirational  impatient and unforgiving. this is no longer a country of meena kumaris. those of my vintage will know what this means. but to put it in context for the younger readers  meena kumari was the tragedy queen of the     s  and the entire theatre broke out in tears the moment she appeared on screen. our mothers would tell us in those days to take two handkerchiefs if we were going to watch a meena kumari film.at some point at the turn of the century  i would even say  in the wake of the kargil turnaround  the new generation of indians dumped that negative  defeatist  self pitying   kasam tumhari main ro padungi  attitude.this new mood was then fuelled by a decade of rising growth  increased global respect for the indian passport  a renaissance of sorts that touched everything  from art and literature  to cinema and sports  and  most importantly  ushered in the emi culture among the middle class.it was at this precise point that the congress  in power  decided to change the script  telling the people of india how badly they were faring and how they had been betrayed by their rulers all these decades. so badly  that two indias had come into being  one shining and one declining. and so  something had to give.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowthe strategy guaranteed not merely defeat in subsequent state elections  but also destroyed from within a government that had achieved a feat not seen in nearly four decades  of an incumbent at the centre winning back power after serving a full term.it broke the virtuous momentum that both the congress led united progressive alliance  upa  and india had been riding since     . suddenly  growth was a four letter word  entrepreneurs were all crooks and crony capitalists  and all indians  besides the rotten billionaires and millionaires  were starving  malnourished or  at best  menial  migrant labourers in the metros.in short  we were being told by the very people an india riding optimism had re elected that we were back to our  reality   a country of meena kumaris.also read  why rahul gandhi s congress is in danger of morphing into a clueless ngothat this self destructive backward march has ensured the congress party s rout in most state elections lately is not the issue. this is a democracy  voters have choices  and someone or the other will be elected to rule us. the damage it did was to india  its economy  its pride  to the national mood and self esteem  or  the india story .every reformist move was blocked by opposition from within the party. its top leaders stopped having any contact with the modernising  entrepreneurial  job creating india. they thought they did not need it. because  in their new  post       wisdom  india s real job creators were the district collectors distributing the miserable mgnrega  nrega until       when it was renamed after mahatma gandhi  largesse.because  isn t that what the vast majority of indians so desperately needed  and  if i may turn the knife  deserved an important and powerful congress mp  a formidable three term lok sabha election winner  not one of those smug  never retiring rajya sabha squatters  made a confession in an in flight conversation last week. he said the party made a suicidal blunder by brainwashing itself that the      victory had come because of mgnrega  when it had  in fact  come from growth.never mind that the data never justified this. in states where nearly    per cent of india s bpl families live  including uttar pradesh  bihar  rajasthan  madhya pradesh  chhattisgarh  jharkhand and odisha  the congress party s strike rate was just about    per cent. the party  or its upa allies  on the other hand  swept every major city  except bengaluru  which was split  and had a nearly    per cent strike rate in the richer states.it did enormously better  for example  even in modi s gujarat than in bihar  odisha or  for that matter  uttar pradesh  which  with    seats  was seen as a success story. the aspirational indians sent a thank you card to the upa. it responded  in turn  by kicking them in the shins. by increasing taxes  emis  blocking manufacturing  mining  shutting down power plants  stopping ongoing projects and investments  and generating massive job losses.that same grateful and resurgent india is now downbeat and furious. and what about the very poor  of course  they are grateful  even for mgnrega  but to the non congress chief ministers who do a much better job of governance and implementation of central schemes.so  what does the future look like to the congress people  they all say two things  one  that power will not return to them in     . and second  that the bjp is also in no better shape  so they will have a couple of years of bjp led khichdi  and  then the remorseful people will have no choice but to bring us back .this is how the congress defines its optimism now. at the same time  you sit with a map of india with any of them and go over it state by state. in the past three months  i haven t met any congressman who reaches three figures.caveat  i haven t been doing much map reading lately with professional rajya sabhaists  the brilliance of whose back room politicking is fully matched by their hopeless ignorance and self righteous loathing of electoral politics.also read  communists who once sided with bjp now irked over no alliance with congress in west bengalwishful thinking is not a virus unique to the congress. the bjp  or rather its rss ite right wing  which has a touching belief that narendra modi will lead them to power soon enough  is equally susceptible to it. but what happens with the congress right now is more important because they are in power at the centre for nearly two more years still.the only good thing for the congress is that it is in deep panic. they have seen the writing on the wall for     . it says  see you later. the party  so consumed by the smugness of a second successive victory that it declared      already won  never even debated the wisdom of its disastrous strategic shift from optimism and growth to povertarian bhookha nanga ism.it cheered from the sidelines  as its durbaris undermined their own government  leaked  whispered and planted vicious stories about the growing distance between the party and the government  about how one was furious and the other sulking  and how a change at the top  a new prime minister  would come any time now.from economic reform to foreign policy  remember sharm el sheikh    from power plants to tax laws  from mining to manufacturing policy  the government was undermined from within. this is a classic political equivalent of some deadly auto immune disease.a recent conversation with a distinguished member of the holy national advisory council  nac  deserves mention here. i asked the very well meaning person  in fact one of the nicest  sincerest people you will meet anywhere  why the nac was always undermining the government  raising impossible demands and then making it look insensitive and anti poor. what can we do  when people are still dying of starvation and so much foodgrain is being wasted  we need that food bill   i was told. but from where will the government fund it   i asked. that the government has to find out   the nac member said. but then  why doesn t the nac also pass a resolution supporting fdi  foreign direct investment  in retail as it would prevent wastage of food  besides improving farmers  lives   i asked. oh  oh  that  you know  will not happen. you know that will not happen   the nac member replied. the conversation ended.my interlocutor was not a career politician. the good thing  therefore  is that at least the real politicians in the congress have now been frightened into seeing the light. that is why people who did the most to destroy upa   s momentum  from infrastructure to mining to power to irrigation to manufacturing to scientific agriculture  are now writing pleas for fdi and hard reform.it is a good sign. it may just give upa   the space to carry out a proper spring cleaning of the cabinet and restore some sanity and poise in its last two years in power.this column

defeating modi at any cost may suit modi baiters  but it can t arrest congress slide
text size  a  a the congress party has swung in full campaign mode for the      general elections with its promise of income support of rs        per annum to the poorest    per cent families under the nyuntam aay yojana. with this move  the party expects to undercut the bjp s potential gains from the rs       annual cash transfer to small farmers and shift the election discourse away from national security and terrorism.many observers say that if the congress manages to reach out to the voters with feel good messages about this plan  it could be a game changer for the party.while empirical evidence on the electoral impact of making such announcements a few weeks prior to polling is rather scant  the congress sympathisers cite the example of their party s promise in the chhattisgarh assembly election last year. reports suggest that farmers in the state delayed selling their paddy in expectation of the congress party increasing the price of paddy if voted in power.notwithstanding this announcement  what are the realistic chances of the congress party in the      elections  the opinion on this is extremely divided. some believe that the congress party has given up its hope on the      elections and is instead preparing for the      general elections.also read  rahul gandhi s nyay raises too many questions   is not the answer to ending povertypolitical commentators have argued that the congress party does not seem eager to make alliances and has been making unreasonable demands on the regional parties in many states.others argue that the bjp is likely to suffer losses in the hindi heartland and the congress is likely to be its principal beneficiary.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowthis argument has been further buttressed by looking at the results of the      elections  when the congress won    seats and stood second on     others. the commentators claim that since many of these second position seats were in the hindi heartland states of madhya pradesh  chhattisgarh  rajasthan and haryana  three of which it now rules   the congress would be a direct beneficiary of any discontent against the modi government.and yet  the optimism around the congress s fortunes in the      lok sabha elections is not borne out by the data. on the contrary  a disaggregated analysis of the      verdict and recent trends on these seats reveal that the scope for gain for the congress party is rather limited for three reasons.first  the congress revival in this election is difficult due to its extremely low base. in       the party s seat tally and vote share were abysmally low  and two of every five congress candidates had lost their security deposit  i.e. polled less than one sixth of the total votes cast . the party may not only find it extremely difficult to cross     seats but may also slide further down in some states.there is no doubt that the congress can win a fraction of     seats where it had stood second  but one can also not deny the possibility of the party losing seats it had won by a narrow margin. in       the congress had won    of its    seats with a margin of less than five percentage points.second  the gap between the congress and its nearest rival in     of the    seats it stood second on was more than    percentage points. in most of these seats  the bjp and the congress are in a direct contest. while the congress may improve its tally by adding a few more seats  a dramatic change in the party s fortunes is unlikely. the bjp had a substantial lead over the congress in many of these seats. the victory margin of the bjp on    of these seats was more than    percentage points.unless there is a massive swing against the bjp  the congress is unlikely to make serious gains in rajasthan and madhya pradesh  where it won the assembly elections in december     . however  congress could certainly hurt the bjp in chhattisgarh.third  and more importantly  a worrying sign for the congress is that in a few states like odisha  tripura  and nagaland  the party is unlikely to be the principal opposition party and may relegate to third position. unlike madhya pradesh and chhattisgarh  where the congress could bounce back after being in the opposition for fifteen years  these states are multi polar. hence  the congress would no longer be the only viable opposition.also read  why rahul gandhi s congress is in danger of morphing into a clueless ngodoes this mean that the congress has done nothing to challenge modi in      while it is true that the party has not gone out of its way to seal alliances  the party does have strong pre election coalitions in many states such as jharkhand  tamil nadu  and karnataka. it is hoping for a revival in uttar pradesh by bringing in priyanka gandhi vadra to campaign and nominating some strong candidates.furthermore  the party has made conscious effort to shift the election narrative from just national security to issues of unemployment  agrarian crisis  and corruption.but the tragedy of the congress  campaign is that none of its charges against the modi government are getting the kind of traction the party would have expected.also read  not only votes  but dividing the opposition helps political parties win elections in indiathere are no easy solutions to the congress  internal dilemma of prioritising between its twin objectives   the ouster of the bjp government or  and  arresting its electoral decline. much like in the game of cricket  when a virender sehwag or chris gayle are in their top form  they give even the best bowlers a run for their money. even a mis hit somehow reaches the boundary and then yorkers get a treatment of a bad full toss.similarly  there are moments in political time when the opposition seems to get nothing right. that does not mean the congress party is unaware of the ground realities and is not doing anything right. recall the      elections  the opposition had stitched a nation wide grand alliance against indira gandhi  yet she emerged victorious with even a bigger mandate.it is very much possible that the congress could end up losing on both fronts by chasing the twin objectives simultaneously. a single minded pursuit of defeating the modi government at any cost may go well with modi baiters  but that may not necessarily arrest the electoral slide of the congress. the party has chosen a high risk  high reward strategy   it may fall flat  but it can also bring windfall gains.rahul verma is fellow at the centre for policy research  delhi. pranav gupta

ousting modi or reviving congress  rahul gandhi knows the answer
text size  a  a congress president rahul gandhi has left narendra modi baiters extremely upset. with alliances largely in place  battle lines drawn  they now know his views on the much debated question about his priority in the      lok sabha elections  ousting modi or reviving the congress but they are unmindful of the fact that it s not pm modi who is the biggest political enemy of rahul gandhi or the congress  it s the regional outfits.a large number of liberals  innately opposed to modi or anyone even remotely linked to the rss and those greatly disillusioned with him due to lapses in governance  wanted the congress president to just dethrone modi. it had as much to do with their ideological pride and prejudice as with their lack of trust in the congress leader to achieve the revival of the congress. they are infuriated with rahul gandhi now because he may have jeopardised  mission oust modi  by taking his own sweet time to seal alliances.also read  why rahul gandhi s congress is in danger of morphing into a clueless ngothe last shotrahul gandhi would have his congress colleagues believe that he is a master strategist who can achieve both goals. it s beside the point that the party s internal assessment as of today gives it    seats only in the coming elections. this tally is expected to go up to     or even     by the last day of polls  depending on whether you are talking to battle hardened warriors or to dream merchants in the congress. if this is the best scenario for the congress in       as per its own assessment  rahul gandhi might be right in driving hard seat sharing bargains with regional outfits.is ousting modi more important for the congress at this stage  so important that it should play second fiddle to regional parties and keep ceding its space  there is near unanimity in political circles and the commentariat  yes  it is. the congress will be finished if modi is in power for the next five years  they say. much of this apprehension emanates from the fact that the saffron juggernaut was unstoppable for five years. modi amit shah virtually attained their goal of a  congress mukt bharat  by last november when the grand old party s rule was reduced to just mizoram  puducherry  punjab and karnataka  as a junior coalition partner . during the same period  the congress has been in disarray and its top leader the butt of ridicule.so  what does the congress achieve by ousting modi  an immediate shot at power  one assumes. and power is the only lifeline of the congress. but can gandhi hope to become the prime minister with         seats in the     member lok sabha we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowtheoretically  he can. manmohan singh became the prime minister in      with the congress tally reading just    . but then the left front gave it a solid cushion of    seats.the congress got     seats in       but it had to prop up a united front government led by deve gowda whose party secured just    seats. the moral of the story is that rahul gandhi could be the last leader to have a shy at the prime minister s post if the congress tally is below      the most optimistic figure predicted by congressmen   especially when      could be the last chance for many veteran non congress leaders to realise their dreams.and if the congress has to prop up a third front leader as the prime minister  why should it cede any ground to regional outfits besides  these arguments are premised on the possibility of the nda not getting a majority. in fact  if the congress is anywhere near      the ruling coalition would have a great chance of returning to power with a clear majority. if one were to assume that the      verdict would be so fractured that both the bjp and the congress would feel compelled to prop up a prime minister from another party  modi and shah have proven talent and resources to deny the congress this opportunity.so  to repeat the question in different words  what should rahul gandhi concentrate on ousting modi by ceding his party s space or using the opportunity to consolidate  if not expand  its base in states also read  rahul gandhi is wrong in thinking anti bjp votes will automatically come to congressstates  step by stepknowing the number of incorrigible optimists in the opposition party  i should present the worst scenario this way  even if modi gets another term  it wouldn t perforce be doomsday for the congress. rahul gandhi must have read john bunyan   he that is down need fear no fall . besides  as the last round of assembly elections in november december showed  when tested against anti incumbency  the saffron party falters as it did in madhya pradesh  chhattisgarh and rajasthan  and earlier in goa and punjab .even if the nda manages to keep the congress out of power at the centre in       the opposition party would be regaining its relevance nationally step by step as    nda ruled states go to polls in coming months and years.there is no state where the bjp could reduce the congress into irrelevance for good  seemingly. even in gujarat where the congress has been out of power since       it has remained a political force to reckon with. but in states where regional outfits have weaned away the congress  social base  the grand old party has been left on the political margins and reduced to irrelevance tamil nadu  uttar pradesh  bihar  west bengal  odisha  andhra pradesh  and telangana  the last two being the most recent .the bjp has shown its ability to feed on smaller  regional parties but it s the other way round in the case of congress. therefore  rahul gandhi s decision to play hard ball with regional parties may not be as thoughtless and reckless as some bleeding hearts in the so called secular camp make it out to be.subscribe to our channels

what narendra modi   rahul gandhi can learn from elections in indonesia
text size  a  a in a hamlet nestled deep in sumatra s palm country  headman slamet   who  like many indonesians  goes by only one name   was eagerly showing off a     meter stretch of concrete to the nation s minister for villages one recent march afternoon.if indonesia s president joko widodo can beat a path to a second term on april     he should give credit to the two meter wide road   and to the popular village fund program that financed its construction  overseen by minister eko putro sandjojo.that    trillion rupiah     billion  program  named dana desa  literally  the wealth of villages   has on average built a little more than     meters of roads a year in each rural agglomeration. modest  think again  the archipelago has        villages. that s         kilometers of roads over the first four years of the program  more than a third of the network that existed in     .jokowi  as the president is known  came to power in     . alongside inheriting a massive shortage of public infrastructure  he also got the benefit of a newly passed law that aimed for the first time in the nation s history to guarantee a part of the state budget to villages. the idea was to let the nearly half of indonesia s     million people who live in rural areas decide for themselves whether they needed a maternity center or a communal toilet.villagers  associations had demanded a billion rupiah for each settlement. but instead of allocating    trillion rupiah  jokowi gave only    trillion rupiah in the first year. even then only    percent of the money was used. so the president plucked the engineer mba eko from the private sector to run dana desa  and doubled the allocation.with        university trained facilitators educating villagers in the complex accounting they need to get their projects approved and audited  fund use is now running at    percent. the budget has bulked up to a minimum     million rupiah per village. depending on area  population and underdevelopment  the amount can go up to   billion rupiah.also read  indonesia grabs the upper hand over india in battle of high yielding bond marketswe are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time

role in jokowi s reelection bid. when it comes to articulating grand ideas  rival prabowo subianto  a pedigreed ex general  wins hands down over former furniture maker jokowi. the urban middle class  who had backed jokowi as an underdog in       is now disillusioned. some businessmen believe they re losing opportunities to state owned enterprises  even as the tax authorities try to extract more revenue from them. signature projects like the chinese built jakarta bandung high speed rail haven t progressed. five surveys give jokowi a lead of    percent to    percent over prabowo   but with    percent to    percent of voters undecided  it could be a close race.to the extent jokowi does have an advantage  it comes from the grassroots where the main issues are livelihood and identity. villages minister eko comes from a political party that represents islam nusantara  a tolerant indonesian tradition at peace with indigenous customs. it s in a battle for hearts and minds with a more puritanical wahhabi influence rushing in from the middle east  feasting on social media falsehoods and hatred. as a result  economic development is crucial. jokowi   or for that matter  indonesia   can t afford a lumpen army of    million millennial voters with nothing to do because the china fueled commodity boom has gone bust.as a former businessman  eko believes in scale. pandeglang district in southwestern java wanted to plant corn. eko s team identified        hectares of abandoned land  organised free seeds  fertilizer and tractors  brokered a sales contract to a poultry feed mill  and then used that to get loans for the villagers. suddenly  a   trillion rupiah corn economy has sprung up in a region where    percent of villages were considered underdeveloped in     . by the end of this year  all settlements in pandeglang will have shed that tag  eko says.poverty in villages has fallen by   percentage point since march       helping pull the nationwide rate to below    percent. dana desa is also fighting stunting in children  thereby lifting future economic capacity. there are lessons here for india ahead of its own elections starting next month  with the two main parties trying to outdo each other on direct cash transfers to people amid agrarian distress and insufficient urban wages. as rathin roy of the new delhi based national institute of public finance and policy puts it  india is transitioning from a development state to a compensatory state.also read  millennial voters will be the face of india   indonesia in     resource rich indonesia  with a far smaller problem of mass poverty  is sticking to development   and there s plenty of work still to do.as we head back toward the airport in bengkulu  eko points to thickets of palm or rubber where trucks can t go. how will people move that produce to markets  he asks. it s no empty musing.if the minister fails to solve similar problems for indonesia s rural population  he risks losing voters to fake news that jokowi is a communist  a christian or an ethnic chinese. that s an issue that should matter to the world well beyond the back country of sumatra.   bloombergsubscribe to our channels on youtube

battle of saragarhi has become a symbol of valour  but battle of koregaon has no takers
text size  a  a there are two battles that are separated in time by almost    years and in space by       km  the battle of saragarhi       and the battle of koregaon bhima       . only one of them got a film  kesari  featuring akshay kumar.there are some obvious similarities between these two events. in both cases  persons of indian origin were fighting for the british. the  idea of india  was yet to be formed  so we can t and should not brand anyone a traitor for being a part of the british army. but let us clear some facts.the battle of koregaon bhima took place on   january      at koregaon  a small village near pune in maharashtra  between the british east india company and the army of peshwa bajirao ii. the company contingent consisted of many dalit mahars  who were considered untouchables by the peshwas. although outnumbered by the peshwa army  the company battalion still won. the battle heralded the end of the peshwa empire in india.the battle of saragarhi took place on    september      at the saragarhi fort in the hills of khyber pakhtunkhwa  in present day pakistan. saragarhi was a small communication post of the british army  manned by    soldiers of    sikh regiment. the fort was attacked by a large number of pashtun rebels because they wanted the british to leave. the battle started in the morning and continued till the evening  and all the british soldiers were killed.also read  what akshay kumar s kesari won t tell you  the real military account of battle of saragarhithe mahars and the sikh both fought valiant and heroic battles  and both were lauded for their bravery by british military historians. inscription on the memorial obelisk at koregaon describes the battle as  the proudest triumphs of the british army in the east . and all the    sikh soldiers  who fought to death in saragarhi  were awarded the indian order of merit  iom .as indians flock to watch and celebrate akshay kumar s kesari based on saragarhi  a year ago violence broke out when hundreds of dalits congregated to commemorate     years of bhima koregaon. the clash saw cars being burnt  stones being pelted and abuses hurled towards dalits. most chose to ignore the moral reason behind why so many mahars had joined the british in their fight against the upper caste brahmin peshwas.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowneither the peshwas nor the pashtuns can be called freedom fighters as they were fighting their own regional battles and sided with the british when it was convenient. the peshwas and the nizams sided with british many times including in the fourth anglo mysore war  which ended the sultanate of tipu sultan. with him dying in this battle  the hope of ousting the british from indian subcontinent ended.in a nutshell  koregaon and saragarhi are remembered as stories of heroic battles of british soldiers of indian origins. but history isn t just about what happened   it s about how we interpret it  write it and choose to remember it. historiography is all about the political choices we and our ancestors have made.while the battle of saragarhi has become a symbol of valour and courage  the battle of koregaon bhima has still not got its due in history.also read  a year after bhima koregaon clashes  here s why the maharashtra village eruptedseveral books have been written on the saragarhi battle. a bollywood movie has been made on it. the punjab government has announced a public holiday on    september in remembrance  and every year  a huge celebration takes place in saragarhi saheb gurudwara to commemorate the sikh soldiers of the british army. the sikh regiment celebrates this day as regimental battle honour day.but what about koregaon bhima  a battle of equal historical importance and grit. no detailed books and no bollywood takers. an independent filmmaker tried to make a movie on this battle  but the project is yet to take off. last year  a few britain based filmmakers announced a movie on bhima koregaon. but this topic hasn t generated much enthusiasm.the battle of saragarhi is celebrated by the state and mainstream press  whereas bhima koregaon is celebrated only by the dalits   and the irony is that they are persecuted for doing so.also read  professors  poet  lawyers  the     maoists  arrested for bhima koregaon violenceso  why this difference in treatment  i have two hypotheses to decode this dichotomy.one  saragarhi was a battle between sikh soldiers of the british army and the pashtuns  who professed islam. so  it suits our mainstream popular nationalistic narrative. the most extreme form of this narrative is  in orwellian language  anything islamic is bad and anyone fighting against the muslim is a hero.second  in koregaon  the battle of the british was against the brahmin peshwas  who had dislodged the maratha king from the seat of actual power and were controlling the empire. fighting against them were the mahars  who were facing the worst kind of human rights violation and oppression during the peshwa rule. for them  it was a battle to reclaim their dignity and rights. that is the reason b.r. ambedkar visited the place on   january     . the narrative of dalits rising against brahminical forces is seen as problematic by not only hindu nationalists but also left liberal democrats. it may explain the silencing of koregaon bhima in nationalist history books. no one loves the story of koregaon bhima as proved by the numerous ongoing court cases against activists.dalit assertions like in bhima koregaon have spooked the narendra modi government. and it won t be hailed by mainstream cinema or historical texts anytime soon  unlike the battle of saragarhi.the author is a senior journalist.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is

with cash transfers  both bjp and congress are showing no imagination in fighting poverty
text size  a  a rahul gandhi has announced what would  if it is realised  likely become the largest single cash transfer programme in the world  in terms of beneficiaries and perhaps even in terms of resources delivered.this initiative has a clear electoral logic in india but also reflects a discussion that has been emerging for some years in the corridors of power   those places in which policies are mooted and packaged  fuelled by the musings of official advisors  think tanks and a few well connected academics   which has been focused on the idea of cash transfers to replace existing social programmes.that idea  which has had adherents both under the previous upa and the current nda governments  where it was respectively promoted by montek singh ahluwalia and arvind subramanian   has found its latest avatar in prime minister narendra modi s pradhan mantri kisan samman nidhi  pm kisan  income support scheme for farmers  and in the plans of the congress party  should it form a government  to provide a  minimum income guarantee .although  conditional cash transfers  that tie cash payments to individual choices  such as preventative health treatments or school attendance    and which first gained prominence in latin america   have been in vogue around the world for some years and promoted by international institutions  payments aimed at supporting a universal minimum income have not been tried on a substantial scale in any developing country. even in developed countries  these don t exist on a national level  although they have been discussed for many years  for instance  under the proposal of a  negative income tax  popularised decades ago by milton friedman .rahul gandhi s proposed scheme is therefore without precedent. he has referred to the planned guarantee as providing a  final assault  on poverty but this is surely hyperbolic. although the electoral aims underlying both the bjp and the congress cash transfers are transparent  that does not in itself invalidate the case for them  a policy can serve political and economic or social objectives at the same time.also read  rahul gandhi declares minimum income scheme for poor  calls it  final assault on poverty what does fatally undermine the case for cash transfers is that they are likely to be expensive  ineffective  and generally to provide a wrong headed approach to creating a sustainably inclusive economy.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowfirst  the  minor  objections to a  guaranteed minimum income  in the present indian context  for one thing  the administrative problems involved in implementing a national cash transfer scheme effectively  reaching intended beneficiaries and avoiding sizable leakages  are certain to be enormous. determining the cost of such a programme is far from easy  but it is likely also to be sizable  and possibly so large as to force painful choices upon the government. if it is intended that incomes will be supplemented to the minimum level  then it is also presumed that it will be possible to identify what the incomes of individuals are. that is itself a forbidding exercise  for which the data and administrative systems at present simply do not exist.moreover  it is likely being assumed that incomes will not shift greatly as a result of behavioural responses due to the introduction of the programme  such as changes in the number of hours worked . the consequences of an income support programme on this scale  for example in terms of its effect on wages and employment  may be quite complex and could be either positive or negative  depending on how it affects both the supply and demand for labour  not to mention family and social structures  over the longer term. there is no indication that there has been even an attempt to evaluate these consequences  whatever famous international economists may be said to have been consulted.the scope for graft in the administration of a programme of this nature is massive  precisely because the benefit is conditional on income falling beneath a specified threshold  necessarily giving great discretion to administrative authorities. such discretion also creates the scope for invidious distinctions between beneficiaries and non beneficiaries  and in the process adds to the power of the petty potentates who administer local government in much of india  ironically adding to the arbitrariness and pervasiveness of state power. a truly universal  basic income   which the proposed minimum income is not  while likely more expensive  would remove this discretion.also read  direct benefit transfers to income guarantee     ways modi govt could tackle farm distressthe choice of threshold is moreover not pegged to any conception of the requirements of people  nor is it clear how it would be updated over time. this lack of a principled basis is a reflection of the political character of the exercise.it is also interesting to note that the premise of the programme is that those it intends to cover operate in a cash  and market based economy. this may be very largely true in india today but it has not always been true. insofar as marketisation and monetisation are not yet complete  the introduction of such a programme will hasten these processes. that may be to the benefit of some. the example of brazil after the introduction of conditional cash transfers shows that they can provide a sizable boost  at least for a time  to aggregate demand and to business opportunities based on growing consumption at the lower end of the income distribution. however  there may be others  for example those still engaged in local barter arrangements  who may not experience these benefits and may even be adversely affected due to a shift in the demand pattern away from what it is that they have to offer. cash centred programmes show a lack of recognition of the diversity of india and of the complexity of the development process.the bjp s pm kisan programme  which is in some respects more modest  is subject to similar  although distinct  concerns. the economic feasibility of large scale cash transfer programmes has increased with national income. the political impetus to transfer resources from growing sectors of the economy  such as the more dynamic parts of the service sector  to the stagnant or shrinking ones  notably agriculture  is enormous.however  and this is the major objection   an ex post transfer programme  let alone an ill designed one  cannot substitute for mechanisms of inclusive growth and development that would provide real opportunities to people to participate in the production process on rewarding terms   as opposed to attempting to make up for the absence of such opportunities  which appears to be the entire thrust of cash transfer programmes.the alternative must focus on widely distributing access to productive assets  credit  and skills  opening new market based opportunities and protecting as well as making more remunerative existing livelihoods. it must also recognise and strengthen the cooperative basis for individual success  for instance  by creating shared production and marketing facilities for small producers  as in the remarkable success story of india s dairy cooperatives .also read  modi s cash plan better than farm loan waivers for short term relief  says raghuram rajanalthough both ex ante and ex post policies are needed to fight poverty  the debate on cash transfers  and the bjp and congress  planned economic steps that have followed it  are evidence that the imagination of the policy making classes in india is focused rather exclusively on ways of making up for the absence of opportunities with after the fact transfers rather than on sustaining and creating opportunities through policies that bring people into the production process more meaningfully and remuneratively.this is not surprising. the electoral benefit of providing immediately visible sops is not equalled by that of interventions that change the structure and dynamics of the economy  for example through distributed public investments in infrastructure and skill development. the required interventions are also harder to bring about  since they require the capacity to design and implement sensible public policies and functioning public institutions to execute them. the justifiable distrust of the state has become such that it is seen as incapable of doing very much in the area of development other than transferring resources. but the fact is that even this is hard to do. the paradox is that the proposed solution to lack of state capacity is an intervention which requires state capacity on a massive scale  albeit in a peculiarly narrow form.the single minded  or simple minded  focus on cash transfers is both an admission of and a formula for the failure of genuine and durably inclusive growth and development. today there is a poverty of imagination as to how to address poverty  and more generally for how to bring about an inclusive economy  which crosses party lines. no number of bank transfers can make up for the lack of a strategy.the author is an

what akshay kumar s kesari won t tell you  the real military account of battle of saragarhi
text size  a  a the battle of saragarhi of    september       recently dramatised in akshay kumar starrer kesari  is one of the greatest  last stands  in military history.the account of the battle is recorded in the digest of service of    sikh  now   sikh  and i was its custodian for two years from      to      as the adjutant. the battle is also described in the personal letters of lt col john haughton  who was the commanding officer of the unit  as reproduced in his biography the life of lieut.col. john haughton .the battle saw one non commissioned officer  havildar ishar singh  played by akshay kumar in the movie      other ranks and one  follower   civilian employed for menial tasks   daad  of    sikh fighting the pashtuns till the  last man last round .but as it often happens  many myths come to be associated with great  last stands   and the battle of saragarhi is no exception.here is what really happened in the battle of saragarhi.also read  kesari sees akshay kumar s rebirth

 . for the next    years  a bitter struggle ensued for the control of punjab. by       the sikhs had prevailed and over the next    years  they had pushed the afghans to the later era durand line         which forms the present western boundary of pakistan. these were the boundaries that the british inherited after they defeated the khalsa army in     .in       the durand line to demarcate the border between british india and afghanistan was created  dividing the pashtun heartland. this led to a simmering discontent among the tribes whose homeland had been divided. apart from garrisoning the area  the british had to send military expeditions to quell the tribal rebellion.in january       half of    sikh was deployed on the samana ridge. the battalion headquarters and one company plus a platoon      all ranks  occupied fort lockhart at the eastern end. one company plus a platoon      all ranks  were located at fort gulistan   .  km to the west.but the two forts lacked inter visibility  and therefore  a post was set up at saragarhi  named after the destroyed pashtun village of saragarh  which acted as a heliograph  signalling device using sunlight and reflectors

the british and the afridis  orakzais and shinwaris  the pashtuns of the tirah region  rose up in rebellion. while the british indian army was building up its force in kohat  garrison town   the

samana ridge held by    sikh. between    august and    september  fort gulistan and the outposts around fort lockhart were attacked a number of times without success.the battle   many accountson the morning of    september  a part of the pashtun rebels invested the vulnerable small fort at saragarhi. the battle began at   am and ended a little after      pm with the entire garrison killed in action. since there was no survivor  little is known of what actually happened at saragarhi.the military account is based on the visual observations made with binoculars telescope from fort gulistan and fort lockhart   .  km and  .  km away respectively from saragarhi.many accounts give a minute by minute description of the battle by signaller sepoy gurmukh singh through the heliograph. the official accounts mention only two such messages   one at    noon  giving a factual report  and the other just after   pm  seeking permission to close the heliograph and join the battle.there is no record of any pashtun account of the battle. hence  most non military accounts of the battle of saragarhi are imaginary and speculative.however  since it was a literal  last man  last round  battle  which lasted six and a half hours  there should be no doubt that all that can be imagined in terms of individual and collective bravery and human emotions would have been on display.also read  how i captured and saved india s first prisoner of war in     what military account saysi have read and re read the digest of service of      sikh and most accounts of the battle written in the last     years. the actual pashtun force that attacked the saragarhi post comprised             rebels.saragarhi had a cliff facing towards the south and a narrow spur linking it to the ridge. it was not practical for more than        men to attack at one time  but adequate reserves were available for repeated attacks. rest of the pashtuns were cutting blocking the route to lockhart and gulistan and also investing gulistan and other forts.the pashtuns initially tried to rush to the post but were unsuccessful. they retreated and took cover behind the boulders and continued firing at the post.as observed from the gulistan fort  two pashtuns had stayed behind to dig under the fort wall to make it collapse to create a breach. being at a dead angle  they could not be seen by the defenders at saragarhi. gulistan tried to warn the post  but the message never reached.at    noon  the signaller reported that one sepoy had been killed  one non commissioned officer wounded and three rifles damaged due to firing. lt col haughton sent lt george munn with    soldiers to create a diversion by firing from a distance  but it had no effect. between    noon and   pm  the pashtuns made two more attacks with        men each  but were again repulsed with heavy losses.at   pm  lt col haughton with lt munn and    other ranks set out to create a diversion and ease the pressure on saragarhi. he had barely moved a kilometre when part of saragarhi s wall collapsed due to the digging by the two pashtun men who had stayed behind  and the final assault was launched.just after   pm  sepoy gurmukh singh sent his last message seeking permission to join the battle. at  .   pm  it was all over.a great saga of bravery had been enacted. most  last stands  are rarely literal as there are always some survivors. saragarhi was literally and metaphorically a great  last stand . each of the    soldiers was awarded the indian order of merit  iom   the highest decoration awarded to the indian soldiers by the british till     .a    feet pyramidal cairn  using stones from the ruins  was constructed at saragarhi and a more formal obelisk was built at lockhart as memorials. two gurdwaras  one each in amritsar and firozpur  were built in their honour.myth vs factmost writers estimate pashtun casualties in the battle of saragarhi to be around     to      .pashtuns pathans were masters of field craft and minor tactics and never indulged in foolhardy head on attacks on well defended positions. as per official assessment  pashtun casualties on the samana ridge were     killed and     wounded  and of them      died in the battle of saragarhi.the iom has been equated with the victoria cross by most writers. no doubt  it was the highest award given to indian soldiers  but the fact that in addition to    ioms for the saragarhi braves     sikh was also awarded another    ioms in the battle at samana and for the tirah campaign that followed dilutes the comparison.writer filmmaker jay singh sohal in his book saragarhi  the forgotten battle busts two more myths   that there was a standing ovation in british house of commons for the battle of saragarhi  and it is listed by unesco as one of the seven epic battles. sohal found no records for both these claims.also read  have a slew of recent bollywood films changed the way indians view war according to the military account  soldiers of the sikh regiment did not have free flowing beards but kept them rolled. they also did not carry kirpans  swords  into the battle as shown in movies and documentaries made on the event. sikh regiment soldiers of that era wore khaki turbans and not kesari turbans as shown in the movie kesari. the akshay kumar starrer film delves into the personality of havildar ishar singh  but no such detailed records on him are available in the military account.the number of men killed at saragarhi was    and not   . most accounts are ignorant about  follower  daad s presence. as the handyman of the post

rahul gandhi is as polarising as modi but indian liberals won t use that word for him
text size  a  a political commentators routinely place the adjective  polarising  in front of prime minister narendra modi s name  but no one uses it for congress president rahul gandhi.the prefix  polarising  fits rahul gandhi just as much.the word  polarise   according to the dictionary  means something or someone who splits or divides people into two opposing factions. narendra modi and rahul gandhi are textbook examples of this adjective because they both evoke extreme love and revulsion. you mention their name in front of a group of people and you will  most likely  part the room into two passionate camps   fawning supporters and angry detractors.the polarisation indexlet s see how the two leaders measure on the polarisation index. rahul gandhi s supporters talk about how he has upped his political game in recent years  how he is active on twitter  is a better orator now  how he delivered victories in rajasthan  madhya pradesh and chhattisgarh  and how he is essentially a decent man who wants to preserve pluralism in india. but his critics will bitterly attack the nehru gandhi dynasty as the epitome of privilegentsia. they talk about congress governments  corruption scams  robert vadra s rise  the lost decade       to       that rahul gandhi wasted in dithering and his multiple soft launches.while modi s supporters talk about his clean image  strong leadership  strident hindutva  surgical strikes and oratory  his opponents point to his hindu fundamentalist politics  economic and foreign policy mishaps and the      gujarat riots.also read  the modi playbook  delay in pm condemning attacks on kashmiris is part of a patternbut both of them have participated in the political theatre of the absurd. and some of their acts have been deeply polarising.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowfor instance  when rahul gandhi tore up the ordinance papers in       or said that congress leaders were not involved in the      riots  or when modi spoke about  shamshaan vs kabristan  in       or recently joked about people with dyslexia.i too have used the prefix  polarising  for narendra modi when i was with the washington post. in       a reader posted a comment asking me why i used that word for such a popular leader. i began to write a reply to the reader  but found that my explanations could have suited rahul gandhi  lalu prasad yadav  mayawati  mamata banerjee and arvind kejriwal too.also read  pm modi joked about dyslexia and set back the disabled community by decadespolarising politiciansthe traditional understanding of the word polarising in the indian commentariat is that it describes right wing politicians and the divisive nature of their politics. now  some readers  especially the congress voters  will accuse me of perpetuating a false equivalence between narendra modi and rahul gandhi. they would like to see rahul gandhi as a  secular  unifier and narendra modi as a right wing divider.but outside india   polarising  is used as an ideology neutral term for both the right and the left. and  curiously  even for the centrists  of late.when former venezuelan president hugo chavez died in       both the new york times and the washington post used the word  polarising  in the headline for their obituaries. mr. chavez left venezuela deeply polarized  his supporters lionizing him as a courageous rebel determined to take on the elites  and his foes painting him as a dangerous demagogue and strongman   the post said.of course  brazil s current far right president jair bolsonaro  us president donald trump and french right wing politician marine le pen are routinely called polarising.the international media goes a step further. can politicians who situate themselves in what was once called the  extreme centre  be labelled  polarising   you can t get a leader more centrist than french president emmanuel macron. in fact  when he campaigned two years ago  the phrase  radical centrism  was used to describe his muscular middle politics.but the financial times began an article about the recent french civil unrest with this sentence   like most important politicians  emmanuel macron is a polarising figure. a gallup poll in      called both barack obama and george bush as the two  most polarizing  us presidents. even hillary clinton was called a polarising politician.but in india  even the extreme left voices are rarely called  polarising . this is because the liberal and left intelligentsia  who were the unchecked gatekeepers of language for the longest time  put the word in the right wing box.the  unfortunate vogue all politics begins with language  and is embedded in its biases. author malcolm coxall wrote in his      book human manipulation that language is not a neutral conduit  but impressions and concepts that are stored in the  information bins  of our memory.  playing games with language and laying linguistic traps are popular pastimes of politicians and politically motivated media outlets   the book said.a      the new york times article about hillary clinton being called  polarising  discussed the word and how it became an  unfortunate vogue . people often use  polarizing  as a place holder for words like  inflammatory  or  strongly disliked    it said.  reporters love the word because it allows them to sound noncommittal and nonjudgmental. it offers them neutrality  limp and passive though it may be. in saying that someone is polarizing  they are saying   there is division  but we won t tell you whether or not it matters . political columnist charles krauthammer first coined the term bush derangement syndrome for george bush haters in     . it was  the acute onset of paranoia in otherwise normal people in reaction to the policies  the presidency   nay   the very existence of george w. bush. that brilliant coinage has now been newly re minted as the trump derangement syndrome. perhaps it is time to import it to india for the two polarising leaders narendra modi and rahul gandhi. there are too many voters who have been so immobilised by their rahul and modi derangement syndromes that they now resort to using the euphemism of the tina factor.also read  what do modi haters say when confronted with the tina factor as rahul gandhi s nyay and narendra modi s pm kisan battle it out in the crucial      elections  indian liberals  hold over language and ideas will also be severely tested. the indian commentariat needs to shed its bias and acknowledge the new realities.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a

communists who once sided with bjp now irked over no alliance with congress in west bengal
text size  a  a the fact that the prospects of a congress cpm alliance in west bengal couldn t even reach the discussion table has apparently irked many people  including some communists.an old comrade i met a couple of days ago was agitated at the development and blamed the congress for being  inflexible  uncompromising  stubborn . he used several other synonyms to that effect and  then rhetorically wondered if the congress has become a b team of the bharatiya janata party  bjp   with soft hindutva as its ideological identity he then waxed more eloquent to say that the grand old party was facing extinction.  there is no need for narendra modi to work towards making a  congress mukt bharat . the congress party  from top to bottom  is in a self destructive mode. despite knowing it faces oblivion  it does not want to sacrifice even a few seats to the aam aadmi party  aap  or to the bahujan samaj party  bsp  or to the communist party marxist  cpm . with this arrogance and adamance  the congress is inviting electoral disaster   he said  displaying a rather strange concern for the congress.he created a very depressing and grim picture of the congress and its president rahul gandhi s leadership. that mood enveloped the discussion for a while. so i just casually asked the self righteous comrade a very simple question.  may i know why the cpm has been miserably routed in west bengal and wiped out in tripura   doesn t it face extinction too  also read  the party is over and there isn t much left of the left in indiathe cpm was in power for    straight years in west bengal   from      to       under jyoti basu  and then from      to       when buddhadeb bhattacharjee was the chief minister . but in a political tsunami of sorts  the cpm was thrown out of power by mamata banerjee s still young trinamool congress. since then  the cpm has not been able to rise from the ashes. all the musclemen in bengal went over to mamata banerjee s tmc. the cpm today says that they are the victims of these  thugs .so  i asked my old committed comrade   why  after nearly    years  were you so hated by the same electorate that elected you election after election from        i was not being sarcastic  just curious. here was his reply   it is all because of the congress backing naxals to attack the cpm cadre in the mid    s. later  the musclemen also helped them do so.  he alleged many of his party comrades were murdered by  mamata s armed gangs backed by the congress .we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowit is not  however  as simple as that. the cpm  or rather the communists in west bengal  have always been anti congress  even during jawaharlal nehru s days. in       when the india china war broke out  a large number of bengali comrades were overtly supportive of the chinese position. the united communist party of india  cpi  witnessed cracks over the issue of china versus soviet union. the party finally split in     .the so called dange faction  led by veteran leader shripad amrit dange  supported the congress under jawaharlal nehru and the soviet union. the ranadive faction  led by dange s rival b.t. ranadive  was pro china and opposed to both nehru and the congress. after the split  the ranadive faction became the cpm and established its hegemony in west bengal. since then  the cpm has consistently and stridently taken an anti congress position.the cpm s anti congressism helped the party come to power  first briefly in       when jyoti basu became the deputy chief minister and ajoy mukherjee of the breakaway bangla congress the chief minister. the coalition collapsed as the extreme radical group in the party became naxalites under the leadership of charu mazumdar  and indira gandhi emerged as the powerful leader at the centre after the congress party split in     .when the congress came to power in west bengal under the leadership of siddharth shankar ray in       the hostility between the cpm and the congress took a violent turn. the dange led cpi supported indira gandhi  even during the emergency. when the janata party was formed in       the cpm supported it and came to power in west bengal  which it would go on to enjoy for the next three decades.by then  the cpi had joined the cpm led left front. so  all comrades were now following the anti congressism as a doctrine  which was formulated by ram manohar lohia. so  who is really responsible for the current scenario where the cpm and the congress are unable to enter the mahagathbandhan  grand alliance  also read  no one can deter mamata banerjee from her unrealistic pm ambitions nowin       the left front had joined hands  euphemistically described as floor management  with the bjp to corner rajiv gandhi and the congress on the issue of bofors. and again in       the  saffrons  and the  reds  came together to oppose the indo us nuclear deal. but the loser in the alliance game was the left. in       the left front had    mps. in       that number came down to   . by the time the      lok sabha election results were out  the left front s strength had fallen to   .with this chequered history  it is impossible for the cpm cadre to adjust themselves with the congress. but somehow  they came together in the      assembly election with an aim to defeat their common enemy  mamata banerjee. but the cpm congress alliance in the state did not help the left. and now  the cpm considers the trinamool congress its enemy number one in west bengal. for the congress  modi led bjp is the main target.now  in the lok sabha election  the fight is at the centre  not the state. mamata banerjee and the congress are both out to defeat narendra modi. but the congress also wants to defeat the trinamool. and the cpm wants to defeat all of them. it presents a complex political algebra  where all four parties are against each other.also read  mahagathbandhan is in self destruct mode because opposition parties want congress mukt bharatfor the cpm led left front  it is not possible to be a part of the mahagathbandhan wherein the congress is a major member. mamata banerjee too cannot join the grand alliance as she herself harbours prime ministerial ambitions. another complicated contradiction is kerala  where the cpm s main rival is the congress. therefore  at the national level  the congress cpm alliance would give confusing signals to the cadre. and that s why the cpm prefers to go it alone.the committed comrade could not solve this riddle and hence preferred to blame the congress for not being flexible and compromising. all opposition parties want a  congress mukt  polity and yet want rahul gandhi to take the lead in establishing the mahagathbandhan. for the congress  with such friends or partners  there is no need for an enemy.the author is a

a rebuttal  reducing priyanka gandhi to her love for rahul   similarity to indira is unfair
text size  a  a writer mayur didolkar assesses prof makarand paranjape s article on priyanka gandhi  and paranjape writes back to him.academic and writer mayur didolkar responds to professor makarand paranjape s article on priyanka gandhi vadra s surprise entry into politics  says it s soft bigotry. paranjape  on his part  argues that the right wing must not be intolerant to truths about dynasty.misplaced arguments in makarand paranjape s article  writes mayur didolkar after professor makarand paranjape s strangely laudatory piece about priyanka gandhi vadra and rahul gandhi the gandhi siblings in theprint  i thought a brief intervention is in order  as much to ask a few questions to the good professor to steer the online debate in the right direction. to note what was missing from the piece  rather than a referendum on the motives behind it.in these polarised times  his arguments reminded me of muneer niyazi s couplet                                                                       makarand paranjape s argument on priyanka rahul equation is misguidedparanjape welcomes priyanka gandhi s entry into active politics as general secretary and head of eastern up for the      campaign. and of course  while no rational person would object to anyone supporting any political leader  the chain of thoughts elucidated in the op ed requires discussion.paranjape writes  what sets priyanka apart is the faultless equation she shares with her brother  congress president rahul gandhi it is sibling support bordering on the unusual if not superhuman that characterises their relationship  not sibling rivalry. indeed  one cannot recall a single careless or critical  let alone damaging comment that priyanka may have passed against her brother. it is this remarkable trait of priyanka that often escapes many. we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowsibling support is essentially a human trait  which is why we say  blood is thicker than water . in fact  so human is the trait that i am really not sure the term  superhuman  is used in the correct context here. superman  wonder woman  batman  ironman do any of these characters have siblings also read  is priyanka gandhi congress  brahmastra for      or will vadra scandals weigh her down the next paragraph about priyanka not passing a single  damaging  comment against her brother is what former us president george w. bush would have termed  soft bigotry of low expectations . since when did  not embarrassing  your sibling in public become a benchmark for  remarkable trait  next  the author speaks about the presser post the up assembly elections in      after the congress had suffered a humiliating defeat. instead  the one defining image that readily comes to mind is of priyanka holding her brother s hand in a rare personal moment before the cameras switched off. there was such non judgmental reassurance in her gesture that no careful observer would have failed to be moved by it. i hold prof paranjape in high esteem  and the intention of this article isn t to mock him. that said  it is impossible for the above paragraph to not remind of those cute  fawning  news  articles by our entertainment media  like  taimur runs after a kitten  gets a kiss from mom kareena . so a sister  belonging to the same political party  didn t abandon her brother in public. call me stone hearted  but i am still waiting to be moved by it.about priyanka s impact on the politics  the prof has this to say  priyanka enjoys tremendous reputation among not only her family and friends circle  but also the congress s rank and file. she is known for her level headedness  practical sense  inner stability  political acumen  and poise. she has no affectations  but is still able to hold her own with just her presence. what is more  priyanka commands loyalty. she is also known to have considerable tenacity and persistence  inviting comparisons with the steely determination and fearlessness of her grandmother  indira gandhi. i think  i could make the case for  facts assumed not in evidence  for the above. what is the measure of success the writer used before stating that priyanka enjoys tremendous reputation among the rank and file  what demonstrable examples of her practical sense  inner stability  political acumen and poise could prof paranjape quote  as i was working on this piece  ani tweeted rs mp subramanian swamy claiming that priyanka suffers from bipolar disorder. the viciousness of swamy s statement apart  isn t prof paranjape s claims of the gandhi daughter s qualities equally unsubstantiated the comparisons with her grandmother actually ask more questions than they answer. first of all  most of those comparisons are based on how priyanka looks like her grandmother  apart from the superficiality of this comparison  the assumption that this comparison speaks well about priyanka is equally problematic.also read  what s your idea of india  i asked priyanka gandhi. it s complicated  she saidwhile i have no doubt the party could do with a campaigner like indira  i am not sure how many indians feel ready for an indira gandhi redux. her tenure as prime minister saw emergency  a dark era when people s civil liberties were trampled upon. her continuation of her father s socialist leaning economic policies kept india s growth sub par through the    s and the   s.many indians like me  who saw economic opportunities open up under non dynasty leaders like p.v. narasimha rao and atal bihari vajpayee  would be wary of accepting another leader like indira. there is also sufficient historical evidence about how loyalty to the member of the nehru gandhi family has not always resulted into well being of the nation as a whole. the idea of an indira like leader evoking loyalty is something to worry about  not to admire.the writer further claims rahul gandhi has emerged as the undisputed leader of the congress. while this statement in itself is not inaccurate  what is conveniently left out is the fact that rahul has emerged as a leader not as a result of any growth the party has achieved during his term as vice president  but because that is how things work in the congress party. even the most ardent dynasty supporters would be hard pressed to explain what other options for presidency were considered  and what achievements of the gandhi scion helped him overcome his closest rival for the president s post.prof paranjape concludes by saying  those against dynastic politics will only criticise priyanka s political debut. but those reconciled to family rule in the party  not to speak of the country  will welcome it. this is a bit of sleight of hand  a clever way to put those who oppose the dynasty rule  and those  reconciled to family rule   on equal moral footing. the people who oppose dynastic politics do so not out of any personal prejudice  but due to the fact that the idea of dynasty runs contrary to the idea of democracy.the people who have reconciled are either the  aise hi chalta hain  style defeatists  or opportunists who know which side their bread is buttered on. refusing to distinguish between these two groups is a grave injustice to the former.at a larger level  this op ed fails in assessing priyanka gandhi on the parameter that every political leader should be assessed on by neutral observers. what are the tenets of her economic policies  what is her position on the ram mandir issue  what side does she come down upon in the lgbt debate  who forms her zero day team and what expertise do those people bring to the table in many ways  priyanka s political success depends upon answers to questions like these. to reduce this debate to her love for brother  and her resemblance to grandmother  is at once reductionist for her and condescending to the voters she is going to appeal to. let s stop talking down to the masses  shall we also read  sibling support  not sibling rivalry behind priyanka gandhi joining rahul s congressmakarand paranjape hits back  right wing must respect diversity and independence of opinionit would be counter productive point by point to rebut mayur didolkar s reaction to my article. we are at cross purposes. he doesn t like priyanka gandhi naturally  he also doesn t like my praise of her. nothing i say will make him change his mind.instead  let me ask him a counter question  is it an accident that the bharatiya janata party  bjp  is no longer talking of  congress mukt bharat  or  for that matter   parivaar mukt congress  is there a realisation  however unpleasant or unpalatable  that both the congress and  the family  cannot be wished away across the world from north america to singapore  dynasties and dynasts the kennedys  the bushes  the trudeaus  and the lees  to name a few have continued to run democratic countries. in the indian subcontinent  powerful political families have persisted in pakistan  sharif  bhutto   bangladesh  sheikh wazed  zia   nepal  koirala  thapa  pandey   myanmar  aung san  win   sri lanka  bandaranaike  jayawardene   mauritius  duval  jugnauth  ramgoolam   and even the maldives  gayoom .when it comes to india  several political parties are practically  owned  by families. for instance  sp  lok dal  up   rjd  ljp  bihar   dmk  aiadmk  tamil nadu   bjd  orissa   jds  karnataka   tdp  andhra   trs  telangana   nc  pdp  kashmir  and so on.two family run parties  akali dal  punjab  and shiv sena  maharashtra  are allies of the bjp. in addition  both the congress and the bjp  the former far more than the latter  have scions of political families in important positions.families  let us face it  still matter. in all walks of life  at least at this stage of human social evolution  they remain the primary units for the transmission not only of genetic traits and information  but also property  power  prestige  and privilege  not to mention values and qualities. why else would we use the phrase  sangh parivar  even when we detest  the family  so much does my article equate dynastic with non dynastic parties  no  i don t take a call on this issue india s voters must. do they accord non dynastic succession a superior moral position  evidence does not suggest they do. instead  while families give their political heirs a head start  the heirs must prove themselves.why should it be any different for priyanka  but if sibling solidarity instead of rivalry between rahul and priyanka continues to be maintained  the gandhi family and the congress will surely benefit. can anyone afford to deny or ignore that something else seems to bother mr didolkar. is it that i have  by praising priyanka  betrayed the right wing  rw   i believe just the opposite  the rw by being so intolerant to difference of opinion may end up betraying its own mandate  which is to replace the  illiberal  liberalism of the left liberals  lelis .also read  priyanka gandhi can be to congress what sunil gavaskar was for india in west indiesin our tradition  purvpaksha is very important  but today those proclaiming to uphold indian traditions and values seem more interested in mocking and slandering opponents than trying to understand the strengths or qualities of those very opponents.the rw would do better if it respected diversity and independence of opinion. that might make it less  pathetic and laughable  in the eyes of both friends and foes.artificial and policed uniformity is inimical to intellectual life. if a public intellectual is bullied or trolled for offering an opinion that diverges from the sanctioned one  it only means that we don t respect deliberation and argument.a reductive polity and polarised public sphere signals dangerous times for democracy. that is why i am confident that better sense will prevail among right thinking individuals.they will see the value of truth telling regardless of who is in office.mayur didolkar is a writer. his twitter handle is  freentgltymakarand

when nehru s india banned a story on gandhi s murder and godse s past
text size  a  a nine hours to rama reflects our complicated relationship with censorship.fifty seven years after india banned the book nine hours to rama  a fictional account on mahatma gandhi s assassination by hindu extremist nathuram godse  as well as the film based on it  the story of its censorship remains relevant.then government and its ordinary citizens  differing attitudes towards nine hours to rama reflect our complicated relationship with censorship which exists to this day. a rather poor book the book and the film are known for being banned in nehruvian india. they were banned separately and not simultaneously. the novel  written by a historian stanley wolpert  used mahatma gandhi s murder as the central plot.barring gandhi  his killer nathuram godse and godse s accomplice apte  all other character names were fictitious. it attempted to imagine circumstances of godse s life from the beginning that supposedly pushed him towards such a violent act. it also indicated probable neglect by the indian government in saving the mahatma.also read  mahatma gandhi hated movies  but watched   in his lifetimethe indian government banned the book months after it was published in london.  novel banned  toi  sep.        p.   further clarification on the next day said the book ban also implied  possession  purchase and sales of copies of the book already imported

perspective and that some portions were liable to be hurt the feelings of various sections.    ban applies to possession too  toi  sep.          p.  a column in the same edition of the newspaper termed the ban  a meaningless action   noting that most reviews  dismissed it as a rather poor book.  but the customs ban generated some curiosity.  it is difficult to understand how national honour was ever lost by publication of the book or has been regained by its banning   remarked the column and termed the step the reflection of  an exaggerated national ego and a degree of political immaturity.  current topics  toi  sep.          p.  stanley wolpert expressed  shock and distress    sorrow and surprise . arguing for freedom of speech and press  he reminded that founding fathers and leaders of both america and india  shared that same passionate faith in freedom and repugnance of tyranny.  he wanted the government to let people read the book and decide.  if it is a poor job of fictional writing  it will banish itself.  he also reminded india its motto satyamev jayate  truth alone triumphs  and regretted that those words sounded hollow in light of the ban.  ban on a novel  toi  oct         p.  also read  the two family members of mahatma gandhi who dared to disagree with hima reader from bombay retorted that the book was banned  exactly for the reason the motto expounds because it distorts truth.   ban on a novel  mrs. daya patwardhan  toi  oct          p.  years after the ban  wolpert said in an interview to journalist ashok malik  that his first book nine hours to rama was closest to his heart and he couldn t understand the reasons for its ban.  may be i came too close to the truth in describing prevalent sentiments.   i d loved to meet gandhi and the buddha

to be finalised. it was earlier named  day of darkness  but was changed later to become nine hours to rama. by the time book was banned in india  robson had already obtained permissions from the indian government on the basis of    pages of script and completed shooting on indian locations.  last nine hours of gandhiji  p. g. krishnayya  toi  oct          p.   outdoor scenes for the film were

chosen for gandhi s role because of physical resemblance.the film nine hours to rama portrayed the fictional account of godse s activities in the last nine hours of gandhi s life  with liberal use of flashbacks. it could well be called the  fictional biopic  of godse he was even shown boozing and going to a sex worker few hours before the murder to hide safely. as the film s producers submitted it

the decision to the ban the film. he said he was sure  the makers were not aiming to defame gandhiji or anything in india. but gandhiji comes very little in the film itself and the person who is supposed to represent gandhiji lacks all dignity. also read  the reason why gandhi wanted to go to pakistanhe called the film  mistakenly made.  deviations from script in film on gandhiji  toi  feb           p.  the i b minister b. gopala reddy clarified that the script of the film had been seen by the government but there were various deviations from it when the film was shot.a reader from bombay  however  did not buy the minister s claim. deviation or no deviation  she argued  a film based on  a sex ridden  fictionalised account  in which  gandhiji appears exactly in the last three pages of

no way congress  minimum income guarantee will work without raising taxes
text size  a  a irrespective of its merits and eventual fate  the basic income proposal means that this election is now focused firmly on the economy.congress president rahul gandhi s announcement about minimum income guarantee  mig  is the first big idea introduced in the run up to the      lok sabha elections. so far  the election was building up towards one of the many vacuous and noisy contestations that we have witnessed in the last few years  a last minute too clever by half quota for poor upper castes  brazen attempts at stoking hindu muslim conflict  now you see it now you don t mahagathbandhan  cynical coalitional moves  election eve party hopping and media games of who abused whom.in this context  political commitment by the largest opposition party to guarantee minimum income to all poor cannot but stand out.long road ahead for minimum income guaranteemig is not yet a game changer. at the moment it is an empty shell  a shiny cover with nothing inside. rahul gandhi s speeches in raipur and cochin were woefully short on any substance to back this big idea up. all we know is that the congress is committing itself to some kind of income transfer to benefit the poor  should they fall below a minimum level.we also know  from rahul s tone  that this is not a casual throwaway remark  that the congress attaches a lot of weight to this promise  that we can expect a lot in the coming days.however  unless you are an ardent rahul gandhi fan and trust that he will implement whatever he promises  at the moment there is nothing to distinguish this announcement from  pipe dreams  like doubling of farmers  income.for all these limitations  the announcement about minimum income guarantee has already achieved something  it indicates the direction this election is likely to take. the congress has already all but committed to a nationwide farm loan waiver.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowadd to this the idea of minimum income guarantee  and it is clear that the opposition is pushing this election towards economic agenda.also read  it s time to remonetise the indian economy with rahul gandhi s minimum income guaranteeit is also clear that the congress is going to focus on the economically poor  socially marginalised groups like dalits and adivasis  plus neglected sectors like agriculture and rural india.other non national democratic alliance  nda  parties are electorally powerful  but ideologically vacuous and are likely to follow the lead given by the congress in terms of national economic policies. this leaves the bjp with little option except to match or better this proposal in the coming budget.over the next few weeks  the idea of mig would be elaborated  debated  criticised and trashed. but irrespective of its merits and eventual fate  the proposal and its timing have ensured that this election is now focused firmly on the economy and that the last person will come first  at least till the elections. this is the last thing prime minister narendra modi would wish for.will mig become the game changer that the congress has been perpetually waiting for  it all depends on the design behind this idea of which we know very little as of now.we know that this is not a proposal for universal basic income  ubi   a flat cash handout to all citizens irrespective of their means. this is also not one of the modified basic income supplement proposals recently put forward by economist pranab bardhan or former chief economic adviser arvind subramanian et al.this is in the nature of top up cash support for any family that falls below a bare minimum income threshold.grey areasyet  there are several issues that need some clarity. first  will the mig be a government scheme  a discretionary budgetary item  or a statutory right like rural employment guarantee under mgnrega or the right to food under nfsa  the way it was presented  it appears to be a proposal for a guarantee backed by a statute. that is how it should be  but we need to know this for sure.second  what is the minimum amount that would be guaranteed as income  assuming that it is family income that we are talking about  we should be looking at something around rs        per month. this is the minimum monthly salary fixed by the seventh pay commission for the junior most government employee  after taking into account the living costs. logically  the bare minimum standard of living for the government employee should also hold for every other citizen.also read  rahul gandhi s minimum income for poor faces   challenges   cost  targeting   deliveryyou could arrive at this figure through another route. if you think of a family of two adults who work at rs     a day the prevailing average minimum wage it adds up to rs        per month. whatever the amount  the proposal can be taken seriously only when we hear something concrete in this regard.third  what is the mechanism for selection of the  poor  eligible for this support  surely not those who declare an income below rs   lakh a year  on a more serious note  defining and identifying the poor is one of the most difficult exercises  notoriously prone to errors and frauds.the whole point of the ubi was to avoid the problem of targeting. the congress would need to come out with a smart and credible mechanism  different from the usual poverty eradication schemes that suffer from what abhijit banerjee and esther duflo call poor economics.finally  would mig supplement or substitute some of the major schemes that target the poor such as the public distribution system and the integrated child development scheme in a scheme like mig  the devil lies in the details. congress spokespersons tell us that a lot of homework has gone into this announcement. that claim should be tested over the next few weeks  by the media  by experts and by the public. the last thing this country needs is another  jumla  sarkar.but more than direction and design  a proposal like mig is about determination or political will. is this just a pre electoral itch which the leaders find a way to wriggle out of once they are in power  or is the congress willing to put money where its mouth is money is what it would boil down to. any form of mig would cost the government big time. arvind subramanian has calculated that a miserly version of his ubi scheme would cost  .  per cent of the gdp. professor pranab bardhan estimates that if his version of ubi is given only to women  it would cost  .  per cent of the gdp. i cannot imagine how any serious mig could cost less than   per cent of the gdp. that amounts to about rs  .  lakh crore a year  over one seventh of the budget of the central government.this cannot be funded with current revenue level or with some additional surcharge. a recurring payout like this one cannot be met with one time disinvestment etc. no matter how you do your budget maths  something like this cannot be implemented without raising tax revenue.this could take the form of doing away with unnecessary tax exemptions for the rich  higher rates for upper income brackets  or levies like a turnover tax  or a wealth tax  or inheritance tax et al that do exist in many capitalist countries.is the congress willing to commit itself to such a policy if it is  and is willing to say so publicly  that could indeed be a game changer.also read  rahul gandhi pledges

when nehru s india banned a story on gandhi s murder and godse s past
text size  a  a nine hours to rama reflects our complicated relationship with censorship.fifty seven years after india banned the book nine hours to rama  a fictional account on mahatma gandhi s assassination by hindu extremist nathuram godse  as well as the film based on it  the story of its censorship remains relevant.then government and its ordinary citizens  differing attitudes towards nine hours to rama reflect our complicated relationship with censorship which exists to this day. a rather poor book the book and the film are known for being banned in nehruvian india. they were banned separately and not simultaneously. the novel  written by a historian stanley wolpert  used mahatma gandhi s murder as the central plot.barring gandhi  his killer nathuram godse and godse s accomplice apte  all other character names were fictitious. it attempted to imagine circumstances of godse s life from the beginning that supposedly pushed him towards such a violent act. it also indicated probable neglect by the indian government in saving the mahatma.also read  mahatma gandhi hated movies  but watched   in his lifetimethe indian government banned the book months after it was

termed the ban  a meaningless action   noting that most reviews  dismissed it as a rather poor book.  but the customs ban generated some curiosity.  it is difficult to understand how national honour was ever lost by publication of the book or has been regained by its banning   remarked the column and termed the step the reflection of  an exaggerated national ego and a degree of political immaturity.  current topics  toi  sep.          p.  stanley wolpert expressed  shock and distress    sorrow and surprise . arguing for freedom of speech and press  he reminded that founding fathers and leaders of both america and india  shared that same passionate faith in freedom and repugnance of tyranny.  he wanted the government to let people read the book and decide.  if it is a poor job of fictional writing  it will banish itself.  he also reminded india its motto satyamev jayate  truth alone triumphs  and regretted that those words sounded hollow in light of the ban.  ban on a novel

no way congress  minimum income guarantee will work without raising taxes
text size  a  a irrespective of its merits and eventual fate  the basic income proposal means that this election is now focused firmly on the economy.congress president rahul gandhi s announcement about minimum income guarantee  mig  is the first big idea introduced in the run up to the      lok sabha elections. so far  the election was building up towards one of the many vacuous and noisy contestations that we have witnessed in the last few years  a last minute too clever by half quota for poor upper castes  brazen attempts at stoking hindu muslim conflict  now you see it now you don t mahagathbandhan  cynical coalitional moves  election eve party hopping and media games of who abused whom.in this context  political commitment by the largest opposition party to guarantee minimum income to all poor cannot but stand out.long road ahead for minimum income guaranteemig is not yet a game changer. at the moment it is an empty shell  a shiny cover with nothing inside. rahul gandhi s speeches in raipur and cochin were woefully short on any substance to back this big idea up. all we know is that the congress is committing itself to some kind of income transfer to benefit the poor  should they fall below a minimum level.we also know  from rahul s tone  that this is not a casual throwaway remark  that the congress attaches a lot of weight to this promise  that we can expect a lot in the coming days.however  unless you are an ardent rahul gandhi fan and trust that he will implement whatever he promises  at the moment there is nothing to distinguish this announcement from  pipe dreams  like doubling of farmers  income.for all these limitations  the announcement about minimum income guarantee has already achieved something  it indicates the direction this election is likely to take. the congress has already all but committed to a nationwide farm loan waiver.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowadd to this the idea of minimum income guarantee  and it is clear that the opposition is pushing this election towards economic agenda.also read  it s time to remonetise the indian economy with rahul gandhi s minimum income guaranteeit is also clear that the congress is going to focus on the economically poor  socially marginalised groups like dalits and adivasis  plus neglected sectors like agriculture and rural india.other non national democratic alliance  nda  parties are electorally powerful  but ideologically vacuous and are likely to follow the lead given by the congress in terms of national economic policies. this leaves the bjp with little option except to match or better this proposal in the coming budget.over the next few weeks  the idea of mig would be elaborated  debated  criticised and trashed. but irrespective of its merits and eventual fate  the proposal and its timing have ensured that this election is now focused firmly on the economy and that the last person will come first  at least till the elections. this is the last thing prime minister narendra modi would wish for.will mig become the game changer that the congress has been perpetually waiting for  it all depends on the design behind this idea of which we know very little as of now.we know that this is not a proposal for universal basic income  ubi   a flat cash handout to all citizens irrespective of their means. this is also not one of the modified basic income supplement proposals recently put forward by economist pranab bardhan or former chief economic adviser arvind subramanian et al.this is in the nature of top up cash support for any family that falls below a bare minimum income threshold.grey areasyet  there are several issues that need some clarity. first  will the mig be a government scheme  a discretionary budgetary item  or a statutory right like rural employment guarantee under mgnrega or the right to food under nfsa  the way it was presented  it appears to be a proposal for a guarantee backed by a statute. that is how it should be  but we need to know this for sure.second  what is the minimum amount that would be guaranteed as income  assuming that it is family income that we are talking about  we should be looking at something around rs        per month. this is the minimum monthly salary fixed by the seventh pay commission for the junior most government employee  after taking into account the living costs. logically  the bare minimum standard of living for the government employee should also hold for every other citizen.also read  rahul gandhi s minimum income for poor faces   challenges   cost  targeting   deliveryyou could arrive at this figure through another route. if you think of a family of two adults who work at rs     a day the prevailing average minimum wage it adds up to rs        per month. whatever the amount  the proposal can be taken seriously only when we hear something concrete in this regard.third  what is the mechanism for selection of the  poor  eligible for this support  surely not those who declare an income below rs   lakh a year  on a more serious note  defining and identifying the poor is one of the most difficult exercises  notoriously prone to errors and frauds.the whole point of the ubi was to avoid the problem of targeting. the congress would need to come out with a smart and credible mechanism  different from the usual poverty eradication schemes that suffer from what abhijit banerjee and esther duflo call poor economics.finally  would mig supplement or substitute some of the major schemes that target the poor such as the public distribution system and the integrated child development scheme in a scheme like mig  the devil lies in the details. congress spokespersons tell us that a lot of homework has gone into this announcement. that claim should be tested over the next few weeks  by the media  by experts and by the public. the last thing this country needs is another  jumla  sarkar.but more than direction and design  a proposal like mig is about determination or political will. is this just a pre electoral itch which the leaders find a way to wriggle out of once they are in power  or is the congress willing to put money where its mouth is money is what it would boil down to. any form of mig would cost the government big time. arvind subramanian has calculated that a miserly version of his ubi scheme would cost  .  per cent of the gdp. professor pranab bardhan estimates that if his version of ubi is given only to women  it would cost  .  per cent of the gdp. i cannot imagine how any serious mig could cost less than   per cent of the gdp. that amounts to about rs  .  lakh crore a year  over one seventh of the budget of the central government.this cannot be funded with current revenue level or with some additional surcharge. a recurring payout like this one cannot be met with one time disinvestment etc. no matter how you do your budget maths  something like this cannot be implemented without raising tax revenue.this could take the form of doing away with unnecessary tax exemptions for the rich  higher rates for upper income brackets  or levies like a turnover tax  or a wealth tax  or inheritance tax et al that do exist in many capitalist countries.is the congress willing to commit itself to such a policy if it is  and is willing to say so publicly  that could indeed be a game changer.also read  rahul gandhi pledges

rahul gandhi s minimum income for poor faces   challenges   cost  targeting   delivery
text size  a  a rahul gandhi s announcement is certainly good politics  but does it make for good economics congress president rahul gandhi s announcement on a minimum income guarantee for the poor  coming days before the narendra modi administration unveils its own income support plans in the interim budget  certainly makes for good politics. but does it make for good economics with the stress on farmer incomes and rural wages reaching crisis proportions  efforts to loosen the constraints on household budgets were long overdue. a targeted cash transfer holds the highest potential for being a progressive intervention compared to the other options on the table  such as rythu bandhu style investment support or farm loan waivers. but with the congress leadership remaining tight lipped about the scheme s fine print  how should we determine its effectiveness there are three primary considerations for a targeted cash transfer of this scale  cost and financing  targeting  and delivery.also read  it s time to remonetise the indian economy with rahul gandhi s minimum income guaranteefirst and foremost  the congress  proposal makes a significant departure from prior basic income proposals in india by not offering a uniform payout. instead  it would demarcate a certain income level as a  minimum income   and all households earning below this level would be provided with a cash transfer the size of their income deficit. perhaps  the biggest question about this feature is  how that there is a paucity of income data in india is a wild understatement with administrators having a patchy record at identifying the poor  let alone the extent of their poverty. the non trivial administrative costs of such an endeavour are a challenge  as are its political economy implications   just imagine neighbours comparing their respective payouts and finding unexpected results.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowmore broadly  depending on the size of the transfer and its associated financial burden  the financing choices made will be key to determining the programme s desirability. are regressive programmes like fertilizer subsidy put on the anvil  or are relatively well functioning parts of the safety net  such as the food security programme in recent years  cut to make fiscal space also read  politics can distort the intent and value of a universal basic income schemesecond  how will recipients be identified  the programme s framing so far indicates that the poor will be targeted  but the use of bpl cards  secc data  or other forms of geographical or categorical targeting methods comes with varying trade offs and levels of targeting efficiency. in contrast  several economists  including most recently former chief economic advisor arvind subramanian  have suggested the use of exclusion criteria as a more administratively feasible mechanism to target  out  the obviously affluent rather than targeting  in  the genuine poor.finally  how does the transfer reach beneficiaries  if the answer is aadhaar linked bank accounts  then the proposed programme must clearly articulate measures undertaken to prevent transaction and authentication failures  issues with aadhaar seeding  and malfunctioning technology   problems that have plagued aadhaar implementation across a variety of welfare contexts.also read  chidambaram calls rahul gandhi s announcement of minimum income

it s time to remonetise the indian economy with rahul gandhi s minimum income guarantee
text size  a  a congress  minimum income guarantee can stop the continuing decline of india s poor.wiping every tear from every eye  is the opening sentence of the chapter on universal basic income  ubi  in the economic survey of fy      authored by dr arvind subramanian  the former chief economic adviser of india.on monday  congress president rahul gandhi announced the promise of a  minimum income guarantee  for every poor indian household  sans the melodrama of  wiping away tears .the idea of a basic income is so powerful that it has even lured otherwise drab economists to melodramatic descriptions of an economic policy. why also read  rahul gandhi promises minimum income for poor if congress comes to powerthe simple idea behind a basic income for every citizen is that  in a just and humane society  every family must be entitled to some minimum income  without prejudice. universal basic income or minimum income guarantee or just basic income is a policy idea that has been widely debated and discussed in recent times across the world. it is also one of the rare ideas that is acceptable across the economic ideological spectrum from the extreme left to the extreme right. the left likes it for its egalitarianism and the right likes it for its efficiency. perhaps no nation in the world needs this more than india and at no better time than now.the indian economy has been devastated with the self inflicted twin shocks of demonetisation and gst. rural distress is widespread. real income growth has been moribund. jobs and hence  incomes  for youth are scarce. liquidity crisis caused by demonetisation turned into a solvency crisis for many small businesses. the yawning gap between the rich and the poor is widening.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowit is thus time to remonetise the economy. it is time to stop the continuing decline for millions of india s poor. it is time to put money in people s hands. a minimum income guarantee scheme can do exactly this. this is the promise of the congress president to india s poor. this idea has been actively discussed and debated within the congress party for some time now. the manifesto committee chaired by former finance minister p. chidambaram has held various meetings with stakeholders over the past several weeks.also read  politics can distort the intent and value of a universal basic income schemethe minimum income guarantee schemethere is understandable curiosity about the scheme and its details after the announcement by rahul gandhi. the congress party s minimum income guarantee scheme will be an indian adaptation of the universal basic income idea as mooted by economists. it will not be universal  i.e. it will not be for everybody. it will also not be a standard income for everyone. it will be a progressive scheme.the idea is that every family in india must be entitled to a certain basic minimum income that can be determined through a combination of factors such as per capita income  cost of living  inflation etc. the number of households that fall below this basic minimum income threshold can be imputed through economic census surveys. the amount of income support offered for these families will then vary depending on their income distance from the minimum income threshold. this is broadly how a progressive minimum income guarantee scheme can be structured. the exact details of the structure of this scheme  the minimum income threshold amount  the number of beneficiary families are being worked out and will be detailed in the congress party s manifesto  to be released soon.how it will be fundedthere is the other big question of how this scheme will be funded. the congress party is acutely aware of the importance and the need for fiscal discipline. hence  fiscal restraint will be adhered to. it is our belief that the scheme can be adequately funded through a combination of increased revenue  not necessarily higher taxes  and rationalisation of expenditure. let us also not forget that with oil prices at stable lows  this is also the most favourable macroeconomic window to embark on this idea. it is equally important to note that income in the hands of a large number of people provides an immediate boost to consumption and the overall economy.also read  modi govt to announce income support scheme for farmers before union budgetother subsidies and welfare programmesthere is much speculation  and desire on the part of self styled libertarians  that the introduction of a minimum income guarantee scheme will mean abandoning other subsidies and welfare programmes. this is again being too simplistic. subsidy and welfare schemes are of various kinds   cash schemes  in kind schemes  merit subsidies  de merit subsidies  etc. clearly  some schemes are working well and some are not meeting the intended objectives. hence  the need for rationalisation of expenditure rather than a carte blanche rule to do away with all welfare programmes. it must also be noted that any transition to a new policy regime will need to be carefully done and given sufficient time to smoothen the process.also read  govt still can t manage mgnrega promises  even with  highest ever  fund allocationbig datanext  economic commentators agonise over how we can we target poor households and measure the distance from the minimum income threshold. admittedly  this is the most difficult part. but that does not mean it is impossible. using big data and technology  it is much easier to identify households by income distribution today than it was even five years ago.  it has not been done before  cannot be a lazy excuse for not embarking on this idea when the nation needs it the most.overall  let us recognise that india s poor are slipping rapidly into an abyss. headline economic growth has been devoid of jobs  incomes and livelihoods for the needy. existing social welfare programmes are patchy and inefficient. the advent of technology is only threatening to further exacerbate the gap between the haves and the have nots. hundreds of millions of indians are at the risk of being left behind. the minimum income guarantee scheme is the equivalent of india s  no indian left behind  act.the author is the chairperson of the data analytics department of the congress party and a former political economist.subscribe to our channels on

do bjp and congress differ in giving padma awards to muslims   the number story
text size  a  a the padma awards have become a crucial symbol to legitimise muslim contribution in india over the years.the public discussion on the padma awards       it appears  has given a new political twist to the old question of  how many muslims are in it   the question now is   what kinds of muslims are in it  the presence of a muslim farmer who saves cows and a muslim archaeologist who wants a ram temple in ayodhya in the awards list obviously underline prime minister narendra modi government s priorities in identifying its own brand of  good muslims .but modi and the bjp cannot be singled out for selecting muslims of their own choice. congress governments in the past have also given padma awards to ideologically favourable muslims.also read  archaeologist who wants muslims out of babri site   a spice titan  meet the padma winners muslim contribution  thesis and padma awardsthere was overwhelming opposition to the british practice of giving title and awards to  loyal  indians  especially in the late     s. the constituent assembly was keen to abolish this practice and expand the scope of the right to equality.this consensus led to article        of the constitution  which clarifies that  no title  not being a military or academic distinction  shall be conferred by the state .we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowthe padma awards that began in       however  were different from the titles offered by the british state. these awards  technically speaking  were instituted to recognise the  significant contributions  of indian citizens.this idea of contribution went well with an interesting feature of muslim intellectual discourse in the aftermath of partition. people like maulana azad  hussain ahmad madani and syed abid husain began to highlight the contributions of muslims in the making of india.the monuments built by muslims  the syncretic sufi bhakti traditions and the role of muslims in the freedom movements were invoked to favour the unity in diversity thesis.arguments of this kind helped the nehruvian state to work out an overtly secular imagination of the indian nation   especially in the     s when the residual post partition suspicion of muslims was still rife. so  the padma awards emerged as a crucial symbol to legitimise muslim contribution.educationist dr zakir husain  who later became the president of india and the leader of the jamiat ulam e hind and maulana husain ahmad madani  who called upon muslims to give up politics of all kind and participate in the nation building project  were the first two muslims who were awarded the padma vibhushan and padma bhushan respectively in     .  dr zakir husain was also the first muslim to receive the bharat ratna award in     . this led to a distinctive postcolonial political norm where governments  irrespective of political ideological orientations  tried to produce an inclusive list of padma awards every year in which muslims names figured prominently.also read  bjp wants to defeat the idea of muslim vote bank by using muslimshow many muslims a systematic study of padma awards underlines this norm.a total of       padma awards have been conferred in the period between            out of which     have been given to muslims  including six bharat ratnas . it means the muslim share in the padma awards is approximately   per cent. given the overall educational backwardness and economic marginalisation of muslims in india  this figure cannot be called unimpressive.even as the bjp accuses the congress of  muslim appeasement   it continues this tradition. during the first nda regime                  padma awards were distributed  of which    were given to muslims  including a bharat ratna to ustad bismillah khan    constituting about   per cent. so  the atal bihari vajpayee government also continued the principle of muslim inclusion.nda i            the total number of padma awards given to muslims under nda i was    .nda ii            the modi regime  however  does not stick to this average. the government has given a total of     awards  till       and only    muslims are included in this figure. the muslim share is down to  .  per cent.should this be read as a clear sign of the hindutva agenda of modi government  but  that would be a facile reading. modi did not disown the tradition completely. instead  his government tried to legitimise its own reading of muslim presence through padma awards.also read  bjp is more interested in sachar report on muslims than congress nowpresence or representation the postcolonial story of padma awards underlines two crucial and related points.first  the padma awards reflects the state s imagination of indian society. it shows that all political parties do recognise muslims as an inseparable

priyanka gandhi can be to congress what sunil gavaskar was for india in west indies
text size  a  a ahead of      lok sabha elections  the bharatiya janata party  and not priyanka  faces a bigger challenge.priyanka gandhi vadra s much anticipated plunge has definitely brought in a freshness in the political theatre.but whether the freshness would prove to be a game changer or not will be seen only after the election results are out. what nobody can deny is that she has jolted the conventional wisdom and the jaded political debates.she could be the opening batsman for the congress  the way sunil gavaskar was for india in the west indies tour five decades ago. she can score a century  or a double century and become a star. even if she is not the match winner  her role of an opener  having faced the bjp s bowlers  can t be dismissed easily and so  ahead of the crucial lok sabha elections  the bharatiya janata party  and not priyanka  faces a bigger challenge.also read  priyanka gandhi vadra  the princess without the crownin a league of her ownmost so called weapons to stall priyanka s entry have been overused and rendered useless.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowshe could not be ridiculed by calling her  dumb  the equivalent of pappu  a pejorative once used for her brother and congress president rahul gandhi.she could not be condemned as a  ruthlessly ambitious  or  power hungry  leader. though she is often compared with her grandmother indira gandhi  no political analyst has seen in priyanka any trace of authoritarianism.she could not be labelled a  foreigner   or criticised for  not knowing hindi  as her mother sonia gandhi was. she is neither seen as the  lutyens  elitist  nor as the globetrotting person with no roots.given there were no chinks in priyanka s armour  during last few years  the rumour mills in delhi have suggested that she was moody. some have even tried to corner her over husband robert vadra s alleged financial irregularities.and yet  her definitive political foray became so sensational and at once hyper dramatic because it provided a refreshing change in today s claustrophobic political environment.also read  priyanka gandhi s success in up will be modi s successwhat propelled priyanka forayin the past few months  panel discussions on primetime debates had progressively become jaded and the headlines exceedingly irrelevant.the newspapers and despite there being so many resembled one another so much that reading them added very little to our information. of course  there were a few notable exceptions. perhaps these are subjective assertions.yet  the media practically manifested the political fatigue that had set in. the only relief from this fatigue  it appeared  was the speculation of  numbers  that would decide the forthcoming lok sabha polls.however even in that  the figures for the bjp  read modi  fluctuated only between     and    . so it is just a matter of    seats  and leading with this number  modi cannot become prime minister again. on the contrary  at     or      he can manoeuvre to win the  confidence vote  by winning opportunist friends.these friends could come from the same crowd that gathered in kolkata to respond to west bengal cm mamata banerjee s appeal. offers of deputy prime ministership  important cabinet berths  or even cajoling can be the means to the end. once the  confidence vote  is won  it could be smooth sailing  or let us say this could be the plan b or plan c of the modi brigade.and such tiresome political permutations propelled the entry of priyanka gandhi vadra the congress s wild card.also read  sibling support  not sibling rivalry behind priyanka gandhi joining rahul s congresscongress s act east policypriyanka gandhi vadra could have chosen delhi as her entry point replacing congress leader ajay maken who made way for sheila dixit  or she could have entered the rajya sabha like a political star.she could have become the  working president  of the party to help assist her brother  to reduce his national burden.but rahul chose her as in charge of eastern uttar pradesh and gave the less tumultuous western uttar pradesh to party colleague jyotiraditya scindia.that was of course upon priyanka s suggestion or perhaps her acceptance indeed  the most difficult assignment.the timing also is crucial. a few days  after  akhilesh and mayawati sealed the formidable bahujan samaj party samajwadi party alliance and following the three stunning victories in the hindi heartland in madhya pradesh  chhattisgarh and rajasthan under the leadership of rahul gandhi.had priyanka entered the political arena before these assembly elections  the victory could have been attributed to her  charisma  and not rahul s aggressive campaign.had she joined active congress politics when rahul was literally in the dumps  reviled and ridiculed  that would have been for her brother s political future end of story.it is obvious that such factors have been minutely scrutinised by the congress  first family  before priyanka s plunge. the detractors from the sangh parivar or from the bsp  the media critics of the dynasty or vadra s deals  will surely be looking at some faux pas so as to mount the offensive on her.but they will have a logistic problem. they will have to target her  not rahul and that would give rahul some operational space.remember issues like the national herald controversy are unlikely to stick on her.also read  by choosing modi   yogi s turf  priyanka signals she s a dynast with a differencethen and nowwill her entry be a game changer  sample a few non analogous but rather relevant comparisons  . soon after former prime minister and priyanka s grandmother indira gandhi declared elections in january       after the    month emergency  most people believed that she will win.but within a fortnight  leaders jagjivan ram  hemavati nandan bahuguna and nandini satpathy broke from the ruling ranks and formed their own party  congress for democracy  cfd .the atmosphere then was claustrophobic  and one of fear psychosis much like india in     . there was a similar fatigue about the pm at that time and her younger son sanjay gandhi.the media in general was non confrontational but many analysts agree that the political equations  particularly in north india  changed radically in       making janata party a winner  . the janata party had found itself in a gridlock within two years of being in power. the political discourse was jaded and there was no way out. but raj narain s rebellion within the party  under charan singh s leadership  changed political situation and six months later  the election saw janata party s rout. one could also say that but for v.p. singh s rebellion confronting rajiv gandhi in       it was unlikely that the congress would have suffered a shock defeat  from     seats to about     in     .note that  so far  there is no open revolt in the bjp but the game changing arrow can strike from anywhere given india s political history.the unexpected and dramatic  with the freshness of personality  may bring about cathartic change. it is not necessary that the congress should win a staggering number of seats to prove such a change.it is enough to put the so called

priyanka gandhi s formal entry is a part of rahul s aggressive strategy for pm bid
text size  a  a congress will have no truck with a party that has any doubts about rahul gandhi being the first among equals in the opposition camp.rahul gandhi is not only  ready  to become prime minister  he will not break bread with anyone who harbours any idea of putting up a challenge.this aggressive alliance strategy indeed leaves no room for doubt about his bid for the pm s post  and sister priyanka gandhi vadra s official entry into politics last week is only one of the many deft moves he has made over the last few months.the up strategythe congress will have no truck with a party that has any doubts about gandhi being the first among equals in the opposition camp.recent mood of the nation surveys commissioned by tv channels have predicted a hung parliament. such projections would further stoke the ambitions of many in the anti bjp brigade. but the congress is not prepared to encourage them any longer not even for the grandiloquent cause of a  modi mukt bharat .bahujan samaj party  bsp  chief mayawati is the most aggressive among the lot of prime ministerial hopefuls. along with akhilesh yadav who sees the next prime minister coming from up keeping options open among mayawati  his father mulayam singh yadav and amethi mp rahul gandhi   the bsp chief sought to cut the congress down to size in uttar pradesh and elsewhere.but rahul gandhi has hit back with the best weapon available in his arsenal in uttar pradesh  priyanka gandhi vadra. the idea is to win more seats outside the family borough of amethi and rae bareli even it comes at the expense of the sp bsp and to the bjp s advantage.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support

national level  there were two who sought to defer the issue of prime ministership post election andhra pradesh cm chandrababu naidu and west bengal cm mamata banerjee.after m.k. stalin of the dravida munnetra kazhagam  dmk  proposed rahul s name for the opposition s prime ministerial candidate last month  naidu sought to differ  stating at a function in visakhapatnam that the name would be decided post elections.the congress has now decided not to ally with naidu s telugu desam party  tdp  even though the former again faces the prospects of decimation in the state where it had drawn a blank in the lok sabha and assembly elections in     .the congress will also have no tie up with mamata banerjee s trinamool congress in west bengal where the bjp has got a huge momentum going in its favour. saffron party leaders believe it could win    of the    lok sabha seats in the state. it s a tall claim and one takes it with a pinch of salt. but who saw the bjp sweeping tripura until it happened apart from mayawati  banerjee is the only one in the non congress  non bjp grouping who can reach anywhere close to the magic figure of    in the lok sabha in      elections the minimum number of seats that political strategists believe would be essential for a leader to make a claim for the coveted throne in delhi in the event of a hung parliament.the tmc chief enjoys a good rapport with the nehru gandhi family but is also known to have uninhibited ambitions.also read  no one can deter mamata banerjee from her unrealistic pm ambitions nowsupport for rahul gandhithere is a longer list of prime ministerial hopefuls  apart from mayawati  naidu  and banerjee. but the others on the list have kept the congress in good humour.former prime minister h.d. deve gowda of the jd s  has publicly stated that he will have no hesitation in backing rahul gandhi as pm. sharad pawar of the nationalist congress party  ncp  has suggested that the prime minister would be chosen from the  opposition  party that secures the maximum number of seats  thus endorsing rahul s candidature.stalin has already weighed in favour of gandhi as pm and so has tejashwi yadav of the rjd.the congress s list of alliance partners in the states as of now figures the dmk in tamil nadu  the jd s  in karnataka  the rjd in bihar and the ncp in maharashtra. further additions to the list would depend on what they think about the opposition s prime ministerial candidate nothing less and nothing more.also read  sibling support  not sibling rivalry behind priyanka gandhi joining rahul s congressmake it officialwhile the congress is now following an aggressive strategy to work out alliances that support rahul s bid for the top post  it has been hesitant in formally announcing the pm candidate.till a few months ago  two factors were at play that possibly stopped the party from making an announcement.the first was borne out of a fear of the consequences of a modi versus rahul presidential style contest. the opposition party saw better prospects in a contest that centred on issues and ideologies  and not on personalities.the second factor was the congress  desperation to keep regional leaders in good humour and interested in an anti bjp alliance. while these factors are still relevant  they not necessarily as strong today.now  with most contenders for the prime minister s post not part of its alliance in states  the congress doesn t have to bother much about their sensitivity on this issue.as for the other factor  the recent india today survey has shown that modi s popularity rating is    per cent down from    per cent in january      and rahul s at    per cent  up by    per cent from last year. modi is still more popular than gandhi but the gap is narrowing fast.the congress  therefore  needs to rethink its strategy of not declaring a pm candidate. does it want to show rahul as a leader who is scared of a direct electoral fight with modi or as a doughty warrior who is ready to fight no matter how fearsome the opponent is it s not a difficult choice to make.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis   only you can fix it you are reading

priyanka gandhi vadra  the princess without the crown
text size  a  a there is no empirical evidence yet that priyanka gandhi is an effective politician or a vote catcher.priyanka gandhi vadra s entry into politics was  oddly  both expected and unexpected.expected  because the clamour among the congress workers for priyanka s formal induction had been on for years. the    year old has anyway been an active manager and trouble shooter for the party behind the scenes and her brother  congress president rahul gandhi  clearly needed some rescuing. unexpected  because its suddenness and timing took everybody by surprise  as did the role she chose for herself in charge of eastern uttar pradesh  which by any measure is a tough turf for her party.anticipated or not  priyanka s formal foray into politics sure captured news space  television studio space  social media space and mind space in a way little else has in recent times. a small case in point after the announcement was made wednesday  there was a point when all  or at least most  of the top    trends on twitter were related to her entry.also read  when tv channels talked about priyanka  not chopra but gandhiso  what does this move mean for the congress and is it really as earth shattering as it is made out to be undeniable is the fact that priyanka s entry caused much flutter because of her family name and the dynasty she carries forward along with rahul. to be fair  there is no empirical evidence yet that priyanka is an effective electoral politician or vote catcher. so far  she has managed the amethi rae bareli region her family stronghold and the assembly poll results there in recent times haven t been too encouraging.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowin the      uttar pradesh elections  for example  the congress managed to win just two of the    assembly seats in amethi and rae bareli lok sabha constituencies. in fact  rahul s own victory margin in amethi in      lok sabha polls managed minutely by priyanka saw a drastic dip from well over   lakh in      to a little over   lakh votes. bharatiya janata party  bjp  leader and now union minister smriti irani managed to put up a spirited fight in the gandhi family bastion.her involvement has been backstage and so outside the realm of formal politics that it is difficult to ascertain the level of her success. ahead of the      lok sabha polls  for example  priyanka was actively involved as a backend manager  bridging the gap between the party s old guard and rahul s team  and smoothening the many glaring creases.also read  is priyanka gandhi congress  brahmastra for      or will vadra scandals weigh her down how much she succeeded in this task is difficult to assess considering the congress saw its worst ever electoral performance in that election.thus  despite no real and tangible record  priyanka s entry shook the political ecosystem. the perks of being from the first family of indian politics have ensured she could choose to enter the field when the gandhis felt it was right  and with a handpicked  though undeniably tough  role.besides making headlines  priyanka s entry has brought much energy to the congress rank and file and given a desperately needed boost to its workers. perhaps  due to her breezy charisma  or the freshness she promises. this is also a great opportunity for her to rebuild the party organisation in a state where it has been increasingly  to put it euphemistically  rickety.priyanka benefits from the advantage of being underexposed something that her brother  unfortunately for him  lost long ago.one hasn t even heard or seen enough of her to really judge her. a strong physical resemblance to her grandmother and former prime minister indira gandhi gives the impression of her being a natural in politics  and the one better suited for it among the siblings.also read  what s your idea of india  i asked priyanka gandhi. it s complicated  she saiddespite his fumbling and bumbling  rahul has been the heir apparent of the nehru gandhi legacy  earlier uncrowned and later  crowned. priyanka  meanwhile  has not had a crown  but a halo around her head. she is perceived as the congress  ultimate trump card.the journey for priyanka could

no rahul gandhi  bjp doesn t want to destroy constitution. it s more complicated
text size  a  a rss bjp s relationship with the indian constitution has changed over the years.rahul gandhi said this week that the final motive of the bjp is  to destroy the constitution of india . but the rss and the bjp s relationship with the indian constitution is far more complicated than this simplistic election season rhetoric.prime minister narendra modi and rss  mohan bhagwat have repeatedly pledged complete commitment and devotion to the founding document. but the rss had once categorically rejected it as an anti national document.here is how the trajectory of the rss bjp s relationship with the constitution has progressed over the decades  criticism  review  freeze  appropriate  worship.rss  early discomfort with constitutionthe rss was very critical of the symbols of the newly created republic of india in         period. it opposed the name bharat and instead preferred hindusthan  it remained unconvinced about the tricolour flag  and it did not find anything  national  in the constitution.also read  jana sangh founder s.p. mukherjee had a love hate relationship with congressbharatiya jana sangh and indian constitutionthe rss  unease with the constitution can also be found in the documents of the bharatiya jana sangh  political predecessor of the bjp  formed in      by rss activists . its      manifesto clearly said that the jana sangh is committed to establish a  dharam rajya based on rule of law  for the revival of bharatiya culture and revitalization of true bharatiya nationalism   bharatiya jan sangh party documents  vol.   bjs publication  new

and theprint s future. subscribe nowalthough the bharatiya jana sangh  bjs  began to appreciate a few constitutional ideals in later years  the party found the idea of constitutional federalism deeply disturbing. the bjs drew inspirations from the rss s stated critique of the constitution  which was articulated systematically by m.s. golwalkar in the     s.golwalkar rejected the constitution on three counts.first  he believed that  the framers of the constitutions were not firmly rooted in the conviction of a single homogeneous nationhood  and therefore they couldn t think of a unitary form of the government  bunch of thoughts  p     .second  the  mind and reason of the leaders were conditioned by the obsession of federation of states  and it prevented them to realise the political and cultural oneness of india  bunch of thoughts  p     .third  he argued that the constitution  has absolutely nothing  which can be called our own   bunch of thoughts  p    .to counter this problematic set up  golwalkar made a bold proposal  the  effective step will be to bury deep  .a federal structure of our country s constitution  to sweep away the existence of all  autonomous  or semi autonomous  states   and proclaim  one country  one state  one legislature  one executive   bunch of thoughts  p     . this critique of constitutional federalism is also recognised as one of the core principles by the bjs  bharatiya jan sangh party documents  vol.   bjs publication  new delhi  p    . it was only in the     s that the bjp began to support the idea of balanced federalism.but  the most elaborate critique of the constitution was articulated by jana sangh leader balraj madhok. justifying the demand for a hindu rashtra  he argued that  for making india truly secular  laws and constitution should be based on hindu ideals. also read  india should be called bharat in all languages  rss linked body demandsthe bjp in the     sthe sangh parivar s attitude towards the constitution changed somewhat in the     s. the bjp  an established opposition party by then  did not use the rhetoric of the hindu rashtra or pseudo  secularism but demanded a comprehensive review of the working of the constitution.in the      manifesto  it stated that the party  shall appoint a commission to review the constitution  in the light of experiences and developments   of the entire post independence period .this led to the formation of the national commission to review the working of the constitution  ncrwc   also known as justice venkatachaliah commission. the ncrwc submitted its detailed technical report in       which somehow went against the spirit of the hindutva critique. the bjp found the report politically useless and ignored it completely in later years.modi s worship of the constitutionhowever  in the     s  the bjp started using the constitution as a political symbol in order to defend itself against the critique of its ideology. narendra modi as the pm candidate of the bjp began his election campaign with a bold declaration that constitution is a  holy book  and the only code of conduct of the government should be  sabka saath  sabka vikas .this newly found fascination for the constitution as a  sacred doctrine  continued even after the impressive electoral victory.    november  the day when the constituent assembly adopted the final draft of the constitution in       was declared as the samvidhan divas by modi government in october     .in a speech dedicated to the greatness of the constitution  modi went on to say that  if there is any creation made by man which is immortal  it s india s constitution .the rss also changed its position. expressing his fondness for the constitution in a series of lectures  mohan bhagwat argued that constitution represents a  national consensus and  therefore  it is a duty for all of us to abide by it obediently .

lectures. he did not even hesitate to disown golwalkar s famous text bunch of thoughts to justify rss s dedication for the constitution. he said that the rss thinking had changed and the bunch of thoughts did not represent the contemporary moment of sangh s politics.also read  mohan bhagwat still sees other faiths as inferior to his own  shashi tharoorreview it  freeze it  appropriate it or worship it the sangh parivar does not want to disown the constitution at all in the name of hindu rashtra. nor do they want to review it. they simply want to freeze it as a dead entity so that it can be transformed into an object of forced worship.this is exactly what nehru warned us against in        while we want this constitution to be as solid and as permanent  nevertheless  if you make

priyanka gandhi s success in up will be modi s success
text size  a  a a three cornered contest to split anti bjp votes is ideal for narendra modi.priyanka gandhi might succeed or fail in uttar pradesh. if the congress party s seats remain in single

spectre of muslim votes in up getting divided  and helping the bjp win more seats than it would have in a bipolar contest.many analysts are presuming the congress will only cut the bjp s upper caste

both rahul gandhi and mayawati are seeking to be the prime minister. given that the sp wants to continue its alliance with the bsp even after the lok sabha elections  akhilesh yadav will only be happy

diminishing the scale of the sp bsp victory in up is important for the congress even if it means splitting anti bjp votes and letting the bjp win some more seats.this was also the reasoning behind rahul gandhi not stopping nitish kumar from leaving the bihar mahagathbandhan and joining the bjp.in the next few weeks  it will be interesting to watch what priyanka gandhi and her party do in up.

sibling support  not sibling rivalry behind priyanka gandhi joining rahul s congress
text size  a  a priyanka and rahul gandhi exemplify the harmony and unity in the ruling family of the congress.priyanka gandhi vadra s entry into national politics has finally been announced with her appointment as the general secretary in charge of uttar pradesh east wednesday. the question of the hour is  will priyanka be the x factor that tilts the scales in favour of the congress this crucial election year political predictions aside  what sets priyanka apart is the faultless equation she shares with her brother  congress president rahul gandhi it is sibling support bordering on the unusual if not superhuman that characterises their relationship  not sibling rivalry.indeed  one cannot recall a single careless or critical  let alone damaging comment that priyanka may have passed against her brother. it is this remarkable trait of priyanka that often escapes many.priyanka and rahul exemplify the harmony and unity in the ruling family of the congress.and riding on this appeal  can the congress  most awaited inductee make a monumental difference to bring india s oldest political configuration back to power also read  is priyanka gandhi congress  brahmastra for      or will vadra scandals weigh her down we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowsilent strength of the siblingone of the most touching visuals of priyanka and rahul s solidarity followed the congress s disastrous showing in the      up assembly elections. samajwadi party chief akhilesh yadav won with a landslide  his party capturing     of the     seats.the mayawati led bahujan samaj party  bsp  and the bharatiya janata party  bjp  came a distant second and third with    and    seats  respectively. as for the congress  it was wiped out  managing a dismal   .it had been a blundering campaign for the grand old party  without a clear strategy let alone the announcement of a leader.rahul s fumbling and unconvincing excuses after the defeat would have raised at least an eyebrow  if not a sigh or sneer  from even the kindest of friends or well wishers. instead  the one defining image that readily comes to mind is of priyanka holding her brother s hand in a rare personal moment before the cameras switched off. there was such non judgmental reassurance in her gesture that no careful observer would have failed to be moved by it.also read  what s your idea of india  i asked priyanka gandhi. it s complicated  she saidsurprise launchafter akhilesh yadav and mayawati announced their decision to contest the      polls together leaving the congress out  rahul gandhi had promised  even threatened  a special surprise almost a secret weapon.if he meant his sister  he did well. it is unlikely that either his followers or priyanka s fans will be disappointed. on the contrary  this would be much more than they expected.in the days to come  when priyanka s role is established based on how seriously she takes up her onerous responsibilities  her entry is likely to be greeted with euphoric cheer  even exaggerated optimism.what could be the reason behind this reception given how low key priyanka has been so far  she has been content  it would seem  to support her brother from behind the scenes  hardly ever speaking at political rallies or campaigning actively.the answer is simple  priyanka enjoys tremendous reputation among not only her family and friends circle  but also the congress s rank and file. she is known for her level headedness  practical sense  inner stability  political acumen  and poise. she has no affectations  but is still able to hold her own with just her presence.what is more  priyanka commands loyalty. she is also known to have considerable tenacity and persistence  inviting comparisons with the steely determination and fearlessness of her grandmother  indira gandhi.earlier this month  priyanka turned    on    january   incidentally  this day also marks swami vivekananda s birth anniversary  who holds a personal meaning for prime minister narendra modi. modi was named  narendra  after his hero  narendranath  which was vivekananda s pre monastic name.in fact  when the pm launches something politically important on the spiritual icon s birthday  its coincidence and attendant irony  if not significance  is not lost on those in the ruling bjp. this year  too     january did not pass uneventfully in the bjp s calendar  on this day  an important working committee meeting of the party was held.also read  by choosing modi   yogi s turf  priyanka signals she s a dynast with a differencethe cost of delayed decisionsdespite her natural political talent  is priyanka s entry into national arena a few years too late certainly her charisma and draw were much greater nine or ten years back. in past decade  she has remained in the background  playing second fiddle to rahul  given him a chance to establish himself rather than unintentionally overshadowing him.this plan seems to have worked  especially in the past two years. rahul has indeed emerged as the undisputed leader of the congress  also anointed president of the party just over a year back. but another reason has changed the nation s perception about the gandhi vadra family.that is the emergence and ascent of narendra modi after      as india s preeminent political personality. in addition to being prime minister  modi commands a stature and space in the public imagination that is vastly superior to all his putative rivals or competitors.and so  it seems as if priyanka s rise as the second gandhi in indian politics has been all but eclipsed.if priyanka is truly a fighter  she will see this as an opportunity  not a drawback. what is for sure is that the contest in uttar pradesh  india s largest state which commands a staggering    seats in the lok sabha  has just become not just more interesting  but hotter.those against dynastic politics will only criticise priyanka s political debut. but those reconciled to family rule in the party  not to speak of the country  will welcome it.the author is a professor and director at the indian institute of advanced study  shimla. his views are personal. his twitter handle is  makrandparanspesubscribe to our

what s your idea of india  i asked priyanka gandhi. it s complicated  she said
text size  a  a priyanka gandhi is tasked with demolishing the bjp in its stronghold  but there is no question of her upstaging her brother.the mother of all elections that will take place in a few months just got more interesting with priyanka gandhi s entry throwing a spanner in prime minister narendra modi s works.twenty years is a really long time in politics. but all those who want to understand why both the sycophant and the opponent sit up and listen to priyanka gandhi should quickly google  arun nehru    rae bareli  and       .in that election for the gandhi family pocketborough in uttar pradesh  a mini mahabharata was unfolding as friends   nay  brothers in arms   faced each other across the political aisle. for the congress there was satish sharma  a friend and loyalist of rajiv gandhi. and for the bjp  there was arun nehru  not only rajiv s closest aide and confidante when he was prime minister from            but also a first cousin.by the time the rae bareli election took place in       rajiv had been assassinated eight years ago in       the babri masjid demolished a year after that  in        which served to banish the congress from up   and sonia gandhi had emerged from her widow s weeds barely a year before  in       when sitaram kesri was ousted and she was crowned congress president.into this politically vitiated rae bareli  priyanka gandhi  all of    years old  unleashed her campaign. and with one  single speech  delivered in chaste and emotionally charged hindi  turned the high stakes election around.also read  by choosing modi   yogi s turf

who shall i speak my mind to if not to you  the people of rae bareli responded to their  priyanka bitiya  s entreaty like it was a family crisis which they were entitled to fix. arun nehru  the bjp candidate  was supposed to win the constituency hands down. he lost badly.fast forward    years  to     . married by now  priyanka gandhi vadra restricted her campaigning to rae bareli and amethi  her mother and brother s constituencies  respectively.also read  bsp sp alliance spooked congress so much that it brought out brahmastra priyanka gandhiin an interview with me at the time  she had said she  will never join politics   but was campaigning in amethi and rae bareli only to strengthen the organisation.what s your idea of india  i asked.priyanka gandhi  that is a complicated question. india symbolises a lot of things for me. it is about the diversity of religions and ideologies   everybody can follow whatever they want. but there is a certain unity as well.it is an answer reminiscent of jawaharlal nehru in the discovery of india  but in pre narendra modi s bharat her words had seemed bordering on hyperbole than reality.in amethi rae bareli  it was clear she was utterly at home with the women s self help groups   samooh   she had helped create  where with little fuss she plonked herself down with several women under the nearest banyan tree.the women were not awed  not for one second. some complained about drinking water  school and health facilities under kalyan singh s bjp government  in power at the time   others grumbled about errant sons and marriageable daughters. but there was no folding of hands in front of the gandhi dynast  none of the  mai baap  culture otherwise so common in hyper male constituencies.those sitting next to her cross legged or on their haunches pulled her cheeks as if she was their daughter next door. she responded in kind  listening  smiling  laughing  taking their affection for granted.journalists gathered around like flies  but she pushed tv microphones out of the way and kept her focus on the small crowds waiting for her cavalcade to stop in up s terrible summer heat. the security guys hung around  but kept back  never in your face  evidently those were her orders. the thing about her  that one noticed  was that she was totally unafraid.this determination that women must march  as the clich  goes   shoulder to shoulder  with men in the making of india and that they cannot be marginalised was as clear much later in march       when the bbc film on the men who raped jyoti singh  or  nirbhaya   was banned by the narendra modi government.in a conversation with me  priyanka gandhi said  i believe it is an outrage to ban the film. we should all watch it and understand the grave consequences of the mindsets we create when we deny even the smallest measure of equality to women. as for the often asked question  as to whether she is like her tough as nails grandmother indira gandhi  priyanka had insisted in an interview with cnn ibn back in      that it was actually her brother rahul who was  much more like her grandmother   while she was like her  by implication  softer and charming  father.priyanka  who dealt with rajiv gandhi s funeral arrangements with a dry eye in public  is keenly aware what such questions signify  including in the present. there was  and is  no question of undermining her brother  rahul. that sentiment was at the forefront in       when she  allegedly  went back on her promise to political analyst prashant kishor that she would lead the congress in the uttar pradesh assembly polls in     .that sentiment remains at the forefront in       as rahul gandhi sends her to lead mission eastern up  where she is tasked with demolishing the bjp in its stronghold. priyanka has made it clear that she is not only rahul s sister  but also an obedient foot soldier to the congress president  and she won t let anybody play divide and rule.certainly  no one in the congress is complaining. a sizzle has just been added to the mother of all general elections.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis   only you can fix it you are reading this

bsp sp alliance spooked congress so much that it brought out brahmastra priyanka gandhi
text size  a  a priyanka could energise congress cadres  but can she take on the might of a united sp bsp alliance brahmastra is the fireball that can destroy the world. it is the weapon of last resort. it s taken out when you have nothing else left. bring out the brahmastra  or face certain death.priyanka gandhi has long been called the congress party s brahmastra. she s finally been used because the congress was facing certain death in uttar pradesh. after the samajwadi party and the bahujan samaj party s formidable alliance in the state  the congress looked like a non factor. uttar pradesh appeared to be a bipolar contest for the first time since     .making priyanka gandhi the general secretary in charge of eastern uttar pradesh will help re energise congress party workers not just in up but across the country. particularly happy will be the allahabad unit of the congress  which has often openly demanded that priyanka gandhi be launched in politics.apart from keeping up the morale of the party workers and sympathisers  priyanka s entry has a novelty that will make sure the congress does not go out of the discussion in uttar pradesh. the media will rush from delhi and lucknow to deoria and lalganj to figure out if the priyanka factor is working for the congress.  is priyanka making a difference   will be a question asked on a daily basis. the hype alone will make sure the congress doesn t look like it s over in up.yet  it is unlikely that priyanka gandhi s entry in politics will change the party s fortunes overnight. its seats will likely remain in single digits. here s why. . three cornered contest but can priyanka gandhi in east up  along with jyotiraditya scindia in west up  actually make uttar pradesh a three cornered contest  for now  that seems unlikely.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowthe caste arithmetic is such that the congress is not even in the race in    of the    seats. voters who are even inclined to consider the congress will see that the congress is not in a position to actually win the seat. winnability will be either with the bjp or with the sp bsp rld combine. this is particularly true of muslim voters. unless the congress can create a perception of winnability  muslim voters won t desert the sp bsp  priyanka gandhi notwithstanding.for those who are unhappy with both the bjp and the sp bsp  priyanka will make the congress look like a respectable third option. this could help the congress end up with a respectable vote share but not a great strike rate in terms of seats.also read  priyanka vadra could be the loose cannon both bjp   sp bsp combine are wary of . national versus regional by launching priyanka gandhi and jyotiraditya scindia  the congress will hope to make the lok sabha election in up national in character  therefore de emphasising the sp bsp alliance. this is how the congress surprised itself by winning    of the    seats in     . to counter the sp bsp alliance  the congress has been harping on its      performance. but      was a four cornered contest and upa   was fairly popular with nrega and a farm loan waiver scheme. the congress had dumped the sp s offer of a pre poll alliance and the bjp was very weak.     is not       but who knows priyanka may be able to help project her party as the main national competitor of the bjp and thereby win a few surprise seats in case  the congress adds to this surprise move by making priyanka gandhi contest varanasi against narendra modi  it could change this election nationally and give a serious fillip to the congress  chances in up.the damage will  at best  be minimal. . brahmins for priyanka it is said that the congress is favoured by brahmins in uttar pradesh. could priyanka gandhi s entry attract brahmins towards the congress once again  this could help earn some brahmin votes especially since the politics of the state is seen as being dominated by thakurs  the chief minister s caste.yet the brahmin attraction

four reasons why the classier  smarter gandhi has finally joined politics
text size  a  a for the congress cadre  a rahul priyanka gandhi combo works better than a solo run for the scion.the recruitment of priyanka gandhi vadra into formal politics was never a question of whether but when. rahul gandhi  it seems  has decided that the time is now  since he is fighting the battle of his life to oust narendra modi from power. and who better to bring to your side than someone more gifted than you in terms of class and chutzpah  at the very least  the party s grassroots  which has been demanding her induction for a long time now  will be enthused.there are obviously many reasons for her appointment as general secretary in charge of eastern uttar pradesh at this juncture. most important among them is the reality that the main fight in uttar pradesh is between the bua bhatija combine of mayawati and akhilesh yadav  who have arrived at a seat sharing deal  which gives them    seats each  with four for the rest  including presumably two to the congress and two to the rashtriya lok dal of ajit singh.this fight between giants   the arithmetically strong sp bsp combine on one side  and the formidable chemistry of the modi shah yogi election machine on the other   leaves the congress out in the cold. what rahul gandhi has essentially done is to accept this as a fait d accompli  and focus on his priority no    defeating modi even if the congress does not directly benefit.also read  protective sonia   bodybuilder robert vadra have finally released priyanka from purdahthe induction of priyanka is intended to challenge the bjp s dominance in eastern up since the minority consolidation in western up is seen to be signed  sealed and delivered by the sp bsp combine. the east is where the bjp needs to be weakened and priyanka gandhi is supposed to do that by weaning upper caste votes away from the saffron combine. hopefully  the presence of priyanka will tie down the modi shah combo in eastern up  making it difficult for them to campaign elsewhere.the second reason has to do with political optics. since the bjp is targeting the gandhi family on scams   national herald  agustawestland and robert vadra s land capers   priyanka s entry allows her to play the victim card  and the gandhi family will claim that vendetta politics is at work. with her husband robert vadra and his mother now under scrutiny by the enforcement directorate in a case of alleged money laundering  priyanka can claim personal victimisation by the government. some voters may buy the story.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowthere could  on the other hand  be a family angle to this decision to get priyanka immersed in party politics. currently  the party s power duo comprises sonia and rahul gandhi  with rahul managing the day to day affairs of the party  planning its strategy and leading it in the next electoral fight  and sonia gandhi stepping in whenever rahul s own clout does not work with the opposition parties.also read  is priyanka gandhi the greatest victim of patriarchy in indian politics sonia s behind the scenes role in the party will remain strong in the foreseeable future  but it leaves a question mark over what rahul will do in case he either has to lead a coalition or work on expanding the party s footprint after the polls and needs a strong hand running the party organisation. logically  it is the brother sister duo that will become the party s key power centre as sonia recedes into the background after may       especially if all regional parties fall in line on rahul s leadership. induction of priyanka gandhi into the party power structure is crucial in this situation  though it is far from certain that the bjp is going to be easily wiped out in     .the last reason for priyanka s induction has to do with media optics and management of the dynasty narrative. while rahul gandhi has found his voice and the rank and file in the party feel more confident about him than ever before  there is a huge phalanx of voters that won t easily buy into rahul. this is where priyanka  with her indira gandhi looks and stronger political instincts  will play a role. the media  never very good at questioning the dynasty  will follow her like a poodle and make small soundbytes go a long way on news channels. this helps counter balance the distrust of voters who have never taken strongly to rahul  and are additionally suspicious of sonia and her italian origins.for the party cadre  a rahul priyanka combo works better than a solo run for the scion.will it all work  difficult to say yes or no right now  as priyanka s role in the campaign is yet to unfold  but it sure cannot do any damage.also read  congress makes      plan with some help from priyanka  pins hope on allies and millennialsthe author is editorial

why bjp and congress love to hate sedition  till they come to power 
text size  a  a every political party questions the wisdom of retaining the sedition law  but only when they are in opposition.the sedition cases against former jnu students  including kanhaiya kumar and umar khalid  and sahitya akademi awardee and assamese scholar hiren gohain show that section    a of the ipc has become the preferred weapon of the country s political establishment   be it the bjp or the congress   to crush dissent.while the congress has  time and again  questioned the narendra modi led government s motive behind the sedition charges against former jnusu president kanhaiya kumar  umar khalid and others  its own upa regime holds the dubious record of using section    a against a staggering       citizens in one instance.the section  first added to the ipc by sir james stephen on    november       was meant to deal with the dissenting voices of indian freedom fighters. while the british india police used it sparingly  often levying just fines to curb dissent  post independence  its use has become widespread.in fact  the use of the sedition law has been at its peak in recent decades.also read  does sedition law apply to jnu   assam cases or is it being used as tool to stifle dissent crushing colonies   and indian democracyto understand how the law has been used in british india and in post independence india in later years as a political tool to clamp down on dissent  let us look at a few examples.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe now             freedom fighter bal gangadhar tilak  who also published popular weekly kesari  was booked for two articles that he wrote criticising the treatment of indians at the hands of the british. years later  he was again booked for three speeches that he made against civil servants in british india.march       mahatma gandhi was booked under the sedition law for writing against the british in young india  his newspaper.may       at a village in bihar s munger district  political activist kedar nath singh referred to cid officials and government servants as  dogs   and the congress leaders as  goondas . he also asserted that the forward communist party did not believe in democracy and supported a revolution.october       the day prime minister indira gandhi was assassinated by her bodyguards  balwant singh  an assistant in the office of punjab education department and his associate bhupinder singh  a senior clerk in the punjab school education board  were arrested in chandigarh.their crime  upon leaving their respective offices after work  the two raised slogans like  khalistan zindabad    raj karega khalsa  and   hinduan nun punjab chon kadh ke chhadange  hun mauka aya hai raj kayam karan da . the last one  roughly translated  means   now we will rest only after hindus are driven out from punjab  time

activist and paediatrician dr binayak sen arrested in chhattisgarh s bilaspur and booked for sedition.his crime  he was an alleged conduit between jailed naxalite leader narayan sanyal and businessman piyush guha. dr sen was sentenced to life and it was claimed that he met sanyal    times at the raipur central jail.the supreme court  in april       dropped the draconian charge against the doctor and held that while dr sen could be a maoist sympathiser and there could be many others like him this alone would not amount to  sedition .september dec             tamil nadu citizens from idinthikarai and surrounding villages were booked for  sedition  and or  waging war against the state .their crime  they held an unarmed  peaceful protest against the kudankulam nuclear power plant which  according to them  threatened their lives and livelihoods.february       some students allegedly raised anti india slogans at an event in delhi s jnu  and participated in an event to commemorate the hanging of parliament attack mastermind afzal guru. among those who allegedly led the march and remained silent when the slogans were raised were then jnu students  union leaders kanhaiya kumar  umar khalid and anirban bhattacharya.  january       the assam police booked an    year old scholar hiren gohain and some others for allegedly saying there would be demands for sovereignty if the bjp led nda government continued to forcibly push the citizenship  amendment  bill.now  in each case  if convicted  these citizens would face maximum punishment of life imprisonment.some would essentially lose their prime years for speaking their minds.also read  what sedition headlines don t tell you about jnu  it s a leader in science researchout of power politicians hate seditionwhen in the opposition  every political party questions the wisdom of retaining the offending section in the ipc. but the moment that party comes to power  it happily uses the draconian law to curb dissent.starting with country s first prime minister jawaharlal nehru  who  in a speech in parliament in       spoke against retaining it in the ipc  to modern day politicians  everyone has spoken out against its gross misuse.nehru  incidentally  had said    so far as i am concerned  that particular section is highly objectionable and obnoxious and it should have no place both for practical and historical reasons  if you like  in any body of laws that we might pass  the sooner we get rid of it the better. yet  it still survives in our statute books  even though in the kedar singh case  it was read down by a constitution bench of the supreme court.in its judgment  the top court held that  criticism of public measures or comment on government action  however strongly worded  would be within reasonable limits and would be consistent with the fundamental right of freedom of speech and expression .the court said   it is only when the words  written or spoken  etc. which have the pernicious tendency or intention of creating public disorder or disturbance of law and order that the law steps in to prevent such activities in the interest of public order. the supreme court  in this instance  emphasised that apart from clause two of article    that calls for reasonable restrictions  section    a is itself violative of article     a  that guarantees freedom of speech and expression.but our governments seem to have interpreted criticism of the government as an attempt to break the country.what else can explain the mounting cases despite the supreme court s decision in the kedar singh judgment last year  in a consultation paper  the law commission weighed in on the possibility of doing away with section    a or reading it down.the commission also said criticism of the government couldn t be treated as sedition  adding   every irresponsible exercise of right to free speech and expression cannot be termed seditious. for merely expressing a thought that is not in consonance with the policy of the government of the day  a person should not be charged under the section .it noted that expression of criticism over leading social problems does not target the idea of a nation   expression of frustration over the state of affairs  for instance  calling india  no country for women   or a country that is racist  for its obsession with skin colour as a marker of beauty are critiques that do not threaten  the idea of a nation .also read  on kanhaiya kumar  the gap between jnu inquiry and delhi police chargesheet berating the country or a particular aspect of it  cannot and should not be treated as sedition. if the country is not open to positive criticism  there lies little difference between the pre  and post independence eras. right to criticise one s own history and the right to offend are rights protected under free speech   it argued.it also pointed out that the uk too had done away with this offending section    years ago. if the britishers used the sedition law to check dissenters back then  india s political class now seems to be using it to crush anyone questioning its actions.nobody knows what action  if any  the indian government plans to take to realise the recommendations made by the law commission.for now  the guillotine of sedition threatens to silence our very basic freedom and right to be heard.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis   only you can fix it you are reading this because you value good  intelligent and objective journalism. we thank you for

lose the loose talk  why we must thank hardik pandya and k.l. rahul
text size  a  a it shows that women may finally matter.cricketers hardik pandya and kl rahul s  debut  on the popular show koffee with karan brought under the spotlight an abominable indian phenomenon  the loose talk culture.the sportspersons aren t the first to have made vulgar public comments about women  but they are among the very few who have paid for it. loose talk culture   an afflictionyou indulge in this  loose talk culture  when you casually comment on the complexion  beauty or sexuality of women and walk away.you are likely to gain a few admirers on the social media who will applaud your  sense of humour  and call you  the life of the party . what is worth noting is  among these admirers there will be women too.those liberal voices at work who speak on women s issues often indulge in  loose talk  when they are seen with the boys  club.is it possible that those who  in the name of humour  berate women respect them  on the show  pandya spoke about his  relations  with cheerleaders. the problem here isn t his association with cheerleaders but how he views them. he said that  at parties  he doesn t bother asking their names he just watches the  girls move . it only shows that he doesn t see women as humans.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your

roast  by comedy group all india bakchod  aib  stirred up a controversy because of its  offensive  content. the video earned   million hits within    hours of going live. it was the top trend in india  and made aib the channel attracting the most subscribers.social media was divided on whether the video and aib itself should be banned over the roast  with one half calling for freedom of speech and the other questioning this freedom.at the time  words like misogynist and sexist weren t being used like they are in the context of the pandya rahul controversy. aib too had indulged in loose talk and used cuss words with abandon when making this viral video while others watched them.supporters said there was nothing wrong with the video  comedians like varun grover came out in support  while actor sonakshi sinha asked how you could send someone to jail for a good laugh. karan johar himself had said   if it s not your cup of tea don t drink it. on the other hand  actor alia bhatt wrote that people should learn the important lesson of not taking life too seriously and filmmaker ram gopal verma went to the extent of saying the aib video proved that india has moved out of the  stone age .those arguing against it said  cuss words  and references to  pornography  were objectionable they couldn t find the right words to condemn the video.also read  hotstar quietly removes hardik pandya koffee with karan episode  raises censorship concernsin       both koffee with karan and aib episodes lay bare our  loose talk culture .it was offensive that pandya admitted that  in the most objectionable way  he watched cheerleaders move. it was offensive that he bragged about his trophies as it were speaking of how many women he had slept with. he sounded just like the character of sanjay dutt from sanju  who brags about sleeping with     women.but loose talk is not limited to  men   this culture is pervasive. take  for instance  the film veere di wedding. it has highly problematic dialogues like  are tu iski le le  as obscene as pandya s confessions.veere di wedding was promoted in the name of women s friendship and sexual freedom. during its promotions  the heroines said they had asked the makers to add more swear words to the script because that s how people talk at home. nothing is wrong with  swear words  until you cross boundaries of decency.our leaders are not far behind. congress leader digvijay singh had called a woman  tanch maal . in       then gujarat cm narendra modi called shashi tharoor s wife     crore girlfriend . jdu leader sharad yadav has been accused of objectionable comments on several occasions.also read  we called out hardik pandya  now it s time to call out colleagues  friends and family metoo strikesthe journey from aib to koffee with karan episodes has been revolutionary. especially for women. needless to say   metoo has changed the way society thinks. today  when we watch a web series we ask questions about its bold scenes and  more importantly  if the actress was mistreated while shooting them.we also ask if such scenes are relevant to the script.look at the irony in       the very men who made  woke  videos on women  such as utsav chakraborty and gursimran khamba  faced sexual harassment charges.in       bcci has taken the criticism pandya and rahul received on social media seriously and suspended both the cricketers  pending enquiry.there is hope yet that people will themselves end this culture of  loose talk  not just on popular shows but also in their lives and begin to respect women.the

politicians like rahul and modi seem adept at spotting sexism in everyone but themselves
text size  a  a while rahul gandhi was downright sexist towards nirmala sitharaman  modi in turn patronised her.poor nirmala sitharaman. she cannot just be india s defence minister. she must forever be the mahila defence minister.if rahul gandhi was downright sexist  modi was being equally patronising towards sitharaman.on one hand  rahul gandhi is taunting narendra modi by saying  chhappan inch ki chhati wala chowkidar bhaag gaya  ek mahila se kehta hai   raksha ki jiye  main apni raksha nahin kar sakta .   the watchman with the    inch chest has fled  he issaying to a woman  save me  i cannot protect myself .  as dhanya rajendran of the news minute tweeted  hmmm  so  women can t defend  on the other hand  modi is turning the insult to him into an insult towards  all the women in india  because  desh ki beti pehli baar raksha mantri hain .  a daughter of the nation is the defence minister for the first time . hmm  so  should that be so mind blowing in this day and age  should that be counted as a giant leap forward for womankind for which women should be ever grateful indians pride themselves on having a woman prime minister before most countries  including the so called developed world  but indian politicians have certainly never shaken off the casual sexism that treats women as lesser than men. whether it s our  daughters and sisters  that we must protect  devis we must put on a pedestal or bob cut ladies we must slut shame  we seem inherently incapable of treating women simply as peers.the sexism just leaks out.what s fascinating is that we are aware of it. politicians seem quite adept at spotting sexism in others  but have a convenient blind spot when it comes to themselves. so sushma swaraj  with all due respect  this latest mahila spat is not a  new low  in indian politics. it s a very old low.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowalso read  ncw serves notice to rahul gandhi for  misogynistic  remarks referring to nirmala sitharamannarendra modi has rallied to defend the honour of all indian women as he bristled on behalf of sitharaman. yet just the other day our defender in chief was mocking  yeh congress ki kaunsi vidhwa thi  jiske khaatey mein rupaya jata tha    who was the congress widow in whose account this money would go  . this is the same modi who once sneered at sunanda pushkar calling her the     crore ka girlfriend . no apologies were forthcoming.bechara indian politicians. they just cannot help it. sexism is just in the dna. sometimes it s blatant and deliberate. remember abhijit mukherjee taunting the  painted and dented  women protesting rape  or how mulayam singh yadav once scoffed  is  mayawati  so beautiful that anyone would want to rape her   no one could miss the misogyny there.but alas  even when they think they are paying a compliment  our netas put their sexist foot in their mouth. there was lalu prasad yadav promising that the roads in bihar would be as smooth as hema malini s cheeks. he probably still thinks he was complimenting the dream girl. and narendra modi went to the women s wing of ficci and talked to them about the  reverence  the word  ma  evokes and why ficci should study lijjat papad and jasuben pizza  womanly things as opposed to running banks or multinationals. in some ways  the out and out misogynist is easier to tackle than the sexist trying to be all woke.what we never seem to get is that  reverence  and mockery are opposite sides of the same old coin. when indira gandhi first rose to power she was dismissed by the old boys club of the congress as gungi gudiya or the dumb doll. when she became all powerful iron lady she was admired as the  only man  in her cabinet  a  compliment  as sexist as gungi gudiya because  of course  a strong woman had to be like a man and men around a strong woman had to be emasculated.  let s not even get into transphobia here .also read  how do we really feel about women leaders the problem is that we still cannot shake off the notion that women s rights flow not from them being human beings and citizens  but in being our mothers  daughters and sisters. so nirmala sitharaman is  desh ki beti  while a manohar parrikar or arun jaitley is never referred to as  desh ki beta . our debates on rape are all about the izzat of mothers and daughters and sisters  as if that familial connection is where all the honour resides. have you no mothers and sisters at home  thunder our politicians to shame those they perceive as being misogynistic. female politicians have to turn themselves into didi  behenji and amma to be both powerful and likeable at the same time.the late jayalalithaa was once asked by simi garewal about chauvinism in films and politics. she said that while chauvinism was bad anywhere  in films women were an essential commodity.  you cannot do without them. in politics  you can do without them. they try very hard to do without them.  and then she added   it s not so easy to just wish me away.  as someone who was manhandled in the tamil nadu assembly  she obviously knew what she was talking about.now the national commission of women has issued a notice to rahul gandhi asking him to defend his  misogynistic  offensive  unethical  remarks as if the vidhwa comment by narendra modi was particularly affirming to the  dignity and honour of women in general . rahul gandhi  trolled for his comments  has dug in his heels and told modi to  stop shaking  be a man.  real men apparently don t shake. they just use women as a punching bag to score debating points with each other.all it goes to show is that men might be from mars and women from venus  but sexism and misogyny are very much of this earth and of parliament in particular. or as the great mulayam singh yadav once said in a different context   boys will be boys . unfortunately so.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis   only you can fix it you are reading this because you value good  intelligent

a new era in tv  rahul gandhi a rising star and arnab goswami critiquing bjp
text size  a  a  chowkidar  pm ignores media and rahul gandhi likes media but dislikes any other subject than rafale.the prime minister was in solapur  maharashtra. at a public rally  narendra modi

decoding the rafale numbers  where rahul gandhi and modi government went wrong
text size  a  a for india  it is the season of miscalculation.in the heated debate on the rafale deal in parliament  the congress  the chief opposition  and the ruling bharatiya janata party  bjp   have been throwing a lot of big numbers at each other.to understand the fine print  it is important to decode the staggering numbers and see how the congress s upa and the bjp s nda fare on the rafale deal.also read  there s a humongous scam in the rafale deal. it is called stupiditythe upa deal that wasn tcongress president rahul gandhi keeps pitting the figure rs     crore per aircraft negotiated by the upa during manmohan singh s tenure as pm for a fully weaponised rafale against the rs       crore per aircraft signed by the modi government for    rafale jets.so  how did the figure  rs     crore  possibly come about  the mrca tender of      was budgeted at    .  billion  which gave the contenders an indication of what india s expectations were. the exchange rate for the dollar in      was about rs     pegging the deal at about rs        crore  or about rs     crore per fighter.the medium multi role combat aircrafts tender  mrca tender  had specific requirements from the indian air force  including the provision of aesa radar  radar warning receiver  helmet mounted display  ability to take off and land at high altitudes in cold conditions  firing beyond visual range missiles and

flyaway cost include the cost of procuring the basic unit  airframe  hull  chassis  etc.   a percentage of basic unit for changes allowance  propulsion equipment  electronics  armament  and other installed government furnished equipment  and nonrecurring production costs. also read  india has a right to know how the cji led bench went wrong with rafale judgmentgiven the conversion rate of the euro was rs    in       the flyaway cost of rafale comes to about rs     crore  which is quite close to the budgetary estimate of the mrca tender.in       the upa government said there was no money to ink an agreement in that financial year  and as elections were due  it was left to the next government to conclude the deal.at the time  the euro stood at about rs     which meant that in rupee terms  the cost of the rafale had escalated to about rs     crore considering the known flyaway cost of    .  million. this is probably why rahul gandhi and the congress quoted the figure of rs     crore.again  here i am merely trying to make sense of the figures being thrown around.the upa government was not close to sealing the deal with france as negotiations were stuck on various aspects of costs and guarantees for the work done by hindustan aeronautics limited  hal . dassault was in violation of the terms of the mrca and lost the l  or lowest bidder status after it escalated costs. the price does not include the design and development cost of the jets which  if added  would take the price to      million a jet.the nda deal that shortchanged indiathe official indication of how much the     jets would cost came from then defence minister manohar parrikar when he said it was pegged at rs        crore     .  billion   or rs     crore per jet.however  in april       pm modi announced his decision to buy    rafale jets. at this point  there was no clarity on how much they would cost. subsequently  negotiations were held and a   .   billion deal signed in september       which translated to about rs        crore. that is where the figure of rs       crore per jet came from.although the government has refused to share the details  a breakup of the cost has been reported. it put the price of    jets at   .  billion  the cost of india specific enhancements stood at   .  billion  spares and other supplies at   .  billion  weapons package at      million and performance based logistics at      million.this is where the problem may lie in terms of the price france has extracted from india. india specific enhancements stood up to nearly     million a jet. all these enhancements as mentioned earlier were requirements in the mrca tender for which all the six contenders  including dassault  had quoted the base price and budgeted.  in       it was a    .  billion deal for     jets. the mrca tender included lifecycle costs that would involve the supply of some of the associated spares currently pegged at   .  billion which again works out at     million a jet.also read  on rafale  bjp is not corruption free but investigation freethese two headings provided the french with the opportunity to probably recover some of the development costs  which stood at     billion. the benchmark price was set when france announced a deal with qatar for    dassault jets  priced at   .  billion in april     . this included missiles like meteor and scalp among others that india too has sought to procure.the cash rich qataris could afford it and their requirement was limited. they subsequently bought another    jets for   .  billion under the  options  clause.note that india has not negotiated any options clause.the congress is  therefore  wrong in saying it would have got the rafale jets for rs     crore since france had breached the mrca terms and was not willing to move from its position.the modi government  on its part  erred in announcing a deal whose price it did not know and handed france an opportunity to rip india off.to put things in

beyond modi waves  ravana airports  what media failed to report on indian science congress
text size  a  a if there are big discoveries to report  relatively little attention will be paid to the preposterous.the amount of information in a message  american engineer mathematician claude shannon realised  is closely associated with its uncertainty. shannon s pioneering work on information theory follows from the simple insight that the more surprising a message is  the more information it carries. if you get a text message saying  the sun will set around   pm this evening   you are likely to ignore it. but if the message reads  expect heavy snowfall tonight   you would be jolted into attention.that s because it is almost certain that the sun will set in the evening  but the chances of snowfall in india anywhere south of the himalayas are almost zero.that s why bad news makes headlines. conversely  we should start worrying if good news is considered headline worthy. that s why most of what was reported about the    th indian science congress last week was about ancient indians possessing stem cell technology and the need to rename gravitational waves as modi waves. as roshni chakrabarty  a journalist covering the congress  wrote there were  hundreds of mind blowing  groundbreaking lectures  but what caught public attention were the two making outlandish claims.also read  modi s space dream  india still doesn t know the difference between tech   sciencewriting about the affair  k. vijay raghavan  principal scientific adviser to the government  noted in his blog that  a group of scientists  chosen by the isca  requests applications to speak and chooses speakers. once chosen there is no censorship on what the person actually speaks  it s precisely the diversity and lack of tight organisation that makes it special. perhaps one should just embrace that. the talks  then reflect the speakers. a few are superb  some good  many unremarkable and few  usually one or two  outright preposterous. he has a very good point. diversity is a good thing. the openness to heterodox ideas is central to science. the question is not one of principle but one of judgment. the scientists and administrators must reflect on whether their decision to admit weird speakers merely for the sake of  diversity  and without imposing the high standards of scientific rigour is worth the overshadowing of the work of hundreds of good scientists. surely  the meetings of the american association for the advancement of science can hardly be called lacking in diversity because they don t allow speakers from the flat earth society.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowthere s another reason why there seems to be man bites dog kind of reporting around the indian science congress  the absence of massive  genuine scientific breakthroughs.also read  indian science congress vows to get its science speakers right after kauravas   newton rowi have not studied the proceedings  so i could be wrong here  but if good uncertainties are lacking  the media will report the bad uncertainties. in the absence of startling scientific discoveries  it is much easier for public interest in the conference to be hijacked by a few people making preposterous claims.we should  therefore  be more concerned about getting more focus  more government investment  more institutions and better communication about science. if there are big discoveries to report  relatively little attention will be paid to the preposterous.pure science requires government investment  but we re not investing enough. india s spending on r d has remained stagnant at around  .  per cent of the gross domestic product  gdp   compared to china s  .  per cent. not only are we underinvesting in absolute terms  we are underinvesting as a proportion of our national income.given the inefficiencies of our governmental system  it s quite likely that our r d expenditure has a very poor teeth to tail ratio  with much of our science budget being spent on non scientific activities. jai anusandhan  is a nice slogan  but let us remember that both the kisan and the jawan  who have been  jai ed  for a long time  suffer from underinvestment. unless backed by budgets and coherent plans  slogans are counterproductive in the sense that they convey the false impression that something is important and underway.those concerned with promoting traditional indian knowledge should be worried too. making absurd claims at scientific conferences on the back of political power turns india into a laughing stock. it makes the world s scientific community a lot more dubious about genuine and promising insights from tradition.also read  this indian scientist says newton   einstein are wrong  harsh vardhan better than kalamwhat we need is greater investment in scientific research focusing on understanding traditional knowledge systems  and extending it from where it ends. for instance  scientists from bangalore s institute for ayurveda and integrative medicine have found evidence that water kept in copper vessels destroys some bacteria and viruses and can be used as a cost effective purification method.the    th indian science congress was convened at jalandhar s lovely professional university. it attracted hundreds of scientists from smaller cities and towns  and thousands of students from the vicinity. all this is worth celebrating.those on whose shoulders lie the responsibility of stewarding india s science ought to use shannon s insight as they reflect on the past week s events.nitin pai is director of the takshashila institution  an independent centre for

why modi who challenged manmohan singh is not ready for a debate with rahul gandhi
text size  a  a what if the pm s trp ratings plunge last week  congress president rahul gandhi challenged prime minister narendra modi to an open debate on the rafale deal. earlier  he had suggested that he was ready even for a comprehensive joint debate. but apparently  modi did not pick up the bait. ndtv held a panel discussion on the subject and asked a bjp spokesperson why modi was not accepting the challenge. there was no forthcoming response.readers may recall that in       modi had similarly challenged the then prime minister manmohan singh to an open debate. so confident was he about his oratorical skill that he believed he could easily destroy singh in that exchange. in       during a visit to the us  i found that a large number of non resident indians  nris   who think everything in the american system is ideal  had instantly supported the idea. suddenly  it began to be seen as the most ideal feature of election campaigning.the competence  capability and credibility of the candidate would be determined by the score they got in instant television polls. the entire english speaking metropolitan middle class seemed hooked to the idea. and they were convinced the modi singh show would prove a great trp draw in which the  accidental prime minister  would be floored  much like a losing wrestler in the world wrestling entertainment  wwe   the famous american tv show   the book titled the accidental prime minister came out later and the trailer of a film based on it just a fortnight ago. also read  when rahul gandhi pulls off a kejriwal and denies modiji the headlineswhen juxtaposed with the shyness and the zero decibel esque voice of singh  the loud and macho modi was sure to impress viewers who were looking for a superman as prime minister. the debate did not take place. but modi s campaign handlers managed to have singh and modi  displayed on a split tv screen giving the independence day address  on august         .we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowsome tv anchors promptly concluded that singh looked miserable and spoke horribly. modi  on the other hand  appeared to be a brave  eloquent leader with  killer instinct . the otherwise timid middle classes saw in modi a saviour and in singh a poor lamb  the corporate executive class saw in modi a daredevil ceo  who would take the nation to american heights and thunder in the security council  giving india the superpower image these perceptions survived almost till last year. had the film the accidental prime minister released in          it would have impressed this gullible middle class. but now  it has been unable to generate that frenzied following because this class has slowly begun to see the hollowness of modi s image like the holograms he used to promote himself.during the vajpayee advani era  the former was a mukhota and the latter a face. in modi s case  it turned out to be the man and his hologram  both illusions of laser driven digital india perhaps the realisation of that hollowness has dawned on modi and his handlers. that is why he did not dare take the challenge thrown at him by rahul gandhi.the media had reduced rahul to the image of not only a  pappu   but also a joker a helpless  hapless  pathetic chaplin like figure. suddenly the little tramp has struck back and the seasoned wrestler does not know where to hide.also read  why the lack of approval from lutyens  delhi bothers narendra modi so muchbattle lines drawnthe idea of the presidential style debate was always absurd  actually even in the us. but it had caught the imagination of the philistines. however  with rahul throwing the challenge at modi  the whole americanised middle class here as well as the nris in the us  have now gone quiet. what if modi cannot reply to the charges made by rahul what if modi s trp ratings plunge  and what if rahul s ratings show a higher score  that would mean losing the election even before polling takes place.therefore  it is better to give interviews to private news agencies like the ani  who are perceived to be willing to promote modi and his government.if indeed it is an independent news agency  why has it not interviewed rahul  or  manmohan singh  and how come all the leading channels pay huge fees to this private agency to televise those interviews  where has the press trust of india gone yet  the presidential style debate would be utterly meaningless. modi can be accused like he has been by many commentators of running the government like us presidents do. however  he does not want to follow the same style and agree to a debate with rahul. with so many languages  races  regions  religions  castes et al  it is truly impossible to reduce the choice of the prime minister to such vacuous debates and their trps.what will happen in the      election will modi again win majority even if not the highest vote share for the bjp  if not  will the opposition come together  pre  or post election  will modi be forced into a multi party coalition and would he be able run it the bjp and rss s junior leaders and activists are wary of modi. but will they actually vote the bjp out these are questions no one will respond to.

neither bjp nor congress wants to engage with the middle class
text size  a  a our leaders may be mistaken about the numbers or the spread of this part of the electorate.india s famed middle class is looking for political patrons. not affluent enough to not care for a sympathetic dispensation and not poor enough to appeal to the bleeding hearts  they are left to fend for themselves today.prime minister narendra modi sounded apologetic in an interview last week as he sought to play to their  swabhiman   pride or self respect   saying that the middle class is not given to living on anyone s  daya daan   mercy  and is the only section of the society that wants maximum benefits to be given to the poorest.thank goodness he remembered them  finally  or should they thank the electorate in rajasthan  madhya pradesh and chhattisgarh  the bharatiya janata party  bjp  got a drubbing even in urban areas in the assembly elections  suggesting disenchantment of the middle class with the saffron party.they had abandoned their traditional loyalty to the bjp to vote for manmohan singh in      when the general elections saw even urban centres rooting for the congress. they loved the face of economic reforms in india and were thrilled to see him take on the apparatchiks in his party to successfully push the indo us civil nuclear deal. they returned to the bjp fold en masse in      when narendra modi led an obama esque  yes we can  campaign built on hopes and dreams.five years since then and until last week  the middle class was a forgotten lot. post       modi amit shah s social engineering strategy took the bjp s expanse and reach to an unprecedented level. its increased acceptability among backward classes  dalits and tribals made it oblivious of the concerns of the middle class as a concrete and homogeneous interest group that serves as influencers for other strata.but the electoral drubbing in the three states has prompted modi to reach out to the middle class again. modi and finance minister arun jaitley  in separate interviews last week  made a desperate bid to change this perception about the party s apathy towards the middle class.  it is our responsibility to think about the middle class  not because they vote for us  but in the interest of the country   said modi.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowthe prime minister s reassuring words to the middle class may have come a wee bit late. but do they have other options  as it is  the rahul gandhi led congress is unmindful of their existence. when was the last time you heard gandhi addressing the concerns of the middle class himself  while we did hear him take a jibe at modi for failing to do the same also read  bjp sees silver lining as congress ups ante on rafale dealgandhi is usually seen either commiserating with the poor or damning the rich and the powerful. if he gets any time in between  he takes a break from the temporal world to consecrate himself to lord shiva. but why blame just modi and gandhi  when was the last time you heard any other political party seeking to engage the middle class  part of the reason is that this class may be aspirational but doesn t come out on the roads to show its solidarity and strength the way farmers  dalits  tribals or other interest groups do.that s why the political class never feels threatened by them. there is also a perception that it s the poor and the farmers who decide the winner in the elections.our political class may  however  be mistaken about the numerical strength or the geographical spread of the middle class today. according to economists sandhya krishnan and neeraj hatekar   rise of the middle class in india and its changing structure   economic and political weekly  june        the middle class in india  those spending between    and     per capita per day  remained  largely stable  between           and            their size  however  doubled between         and         to    .  million from    .  million. these economists used the national sample survey  nss  consumer expenditure survey to arrive at these estimates.they made three categories on the basis of spending per capita per day  lower middle class          middle middle class         and upper middle class         . as per their estimates  the middle class swelled in an  unprecedented fashion  in eight years from          though in the lower middle category because of several people coming out of poverty to join their ranks.their presence also expanded across states and in both rural and urban areas during this period.our politicians have failed to take note of the burgeoning middle class as the former mistakenly persists in believing that paying lip service to the farmers and the downtrodden would pay better political dividends. or that s the wisdom the congress has got from its victories in

that the aspirational middle class is dismayed and dumbstruck by the saffron party s decisive shift from  vikas  to  hindutva  but the bjp hasn t lost them permanently as the congress would like to believe.krishnan and hatekar point out the fact that the upper castes continue to dominate even the new  expanded middle class.  in          when   .   of india was in the new middle class  a far larger share of   .   of upper castes were in the same category  compared to   .    in         . in contrast to this  the lower castes are under represented in the new middle class   the two concluded  even as they added that the massive expansion in the size of the new middle class has benefited all caste groups evenly.what this means is that the bjp  with its traditional bonds with the upper castes  hasn t lost it completely yet. the middle class may be upset with the bjp today for demonetisation  lack of jobs  falling investments and the general sense of insecurity in times of institutional breakdowns. they would give a patient and sympathetic hearing to rahul gandhi whenever he talks about these issues.but to wean this aspirational class away from the bjp  gandhi needs to expand his politics beyond povertarianism and change his anti capital image.also read  unlike anti congressism  politics of anti bjpism is still to ripen in     subscribe to our channels on youtube

when rahul gandhi pulls off a kejriwal and denies modiji the headlines
text size  a  a the parallels between      and      are too obvious to ignore.you know congress president rahul gandhi has finally hit the right note with his audience when it s not a compilation of his  goof ups  or commentary on his wardrobe making news. he has now learnt the art of grabbing the headlines and staying on top of them. it appears as if rahul has picked up lessons from delhi chief minister arvind kejriwal s shoot and scoot rulebook. and the run up to the national election in      is beginning to resemble the feverish months full of scams and allegations before the      polls.after all  what s an election season without the scent of scams that shake things up and take centre stage  and rahul has made no secret of his admiration for the way kejriwal stormed the      delhi assembly election.even after private news agency ani s big interview with prime minister narendra modi  it was rahul who stayed on longer streaming on every news channel. he spoke to the media outside parliament and at the congress office. he spoke in parliament while modi skipped the session.also read  why rahul gandhi was not allowed to play rafale  bedroom  tape in lok sabhamuch like kejriwal in the early days of aam aadmi party  rahul has realised that a shrewd opposition leader is one who poses questions  unrelentingly. rahul is asking pm narendra modi of exam warriors fame questions on the rafale defence deal in parliament  at press conferences and even on twitter.he even appears to be tracking modi s travel schedule and urging students at punjab s lovely professional university  where the pm inaugurated the indian science congress today  to ask questions about rafale.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality

because madam speaker had said   no talking about the goa tape   but the missing q  has become as controversial as rafale   so on popular demand  q . modi ji  please tell us why parrikar ji keeps a

in journalists in this hunt for that  blockbuster byte .also read  rahul gandhi mocks smita prakash  journalists under attack or part of partisan politics rahul accusing modi  saying  chowkidar chor

politicians is debatable  but they definitely ensured he stayed in the headlines and dominated the zeitgeist.a few decades ago  lawyer ram jethmalani adopted the same tactic in dogged pursuit of the bofors scandal. upon his return from sweden after conducting an independent inquiry into the bofors scandal he vowed to produce    questions for then prime minister rajiv gandhi  every day for the next    days . in his words   till you are removed from office  whichever is earlier .he kept up the pressure on rajiv gandhi.one can argue whether rahul s ways are the most ethical  far sighted and honest  but one cannot deny their efficacy. so much so that political analysts have begun to say that  of late  modi has been on the defensive and is following the narrative set by his rival from farm loan waivers to rafale. and unlike kejriwal  he doesn t even have to worry about building a political party from scratch.if elections are going to be lost and won based on videos forwarded over whatsapp there is plenty of content from rahul gandhi of     .finance minister arun jaitley may be reading out numbers to defend his government on the rafale issue in parliament  but rahul is not letting these numbers get in the way of his tirade.rahul has perhaps repeated the word  rafale  the same number of times that kejriwal uttered the words  scam  and  ghotala  in     .something s gotta stick especially when he has to grapple with the spectre of  middleman  christian michel virtually singing during a probe into the agusta westland helicopter deal that shook the upa rule in     . defence minister nirmala sitaraman even managed to bring the  q  of bofors into the parliament debate to counter the  aa  of rafale.having been lampooned as  pappu  and  clown prince  in the past  rahul knows that no label lasts forever and it is possible to shed the image that has been plastered on him. and shed he did take  for instance  the fact that just last week  india today ran a cover titled  the evolution of rahul gandhi .also read  five things narendra modi and rahul gandhi should stop doing in     of course  this isn t to say that rahul s perpetual accusatory mode as it were may not come at a cost.let s not forget that kejriwal similarly fond of accusing his political opponents has spent the past year apologising to several leaders. but  is that such a terrible cost if it can help you reap electoral benefits and so  the big question of the hour is if rahul s rafale storm can bring votes.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis   only you can

the reason why gandhi wanted to go to pakistan
text size  a  a gandhi s proposal to visit cities such as lahore  rawalpindi and karachi after partition had a symbolic political value.mohandas karamchand gandhi is often held responsible for the partition of india. many people  particularly hindu essentialists  accuse gandhi of following the muslim appeasement policy and accepting mohammad ali jinnah s demands for an independent muslim homeland and helping create pakistan. gandhi s desire to visit pakistan is also presented as evidence for this fatal pro muslim and pro pakistan politics.but this is a simplistic understanding of his wish that obviously suits the hindutva led revisionist readings of gandhi. in fact  his desire to go to pakistan may have had more to do with gandhi s critique of the prevalent ideas of political representation and nation state in the subcontinent.the jawaharlal nehru led congress  which emerged as the sole proprietor of gandhi s legacy immediately after his death  defended gandhi s attitude towards  minorities . his ideas on tolerance  non violence and sarv dharm sambhav were invoked to legitimise congress s version of secularism.despite this overwhelming acceptance of gandhi as an icon  his proposed visit to pakistan was not given any serious attention at that time by prominent leaders. even nehru  who conceptualised the principles of  panchsheel  for his foreign policy based on the peaceful coexistence of all nations  did not find any inherent symbolism in this unfulfilled desire of gandhi.does it mean that even nehru was also apprehensive about gandhi s proposed visit to pakistan  was gandhi posing a serious challenge to the prevailing political correctness of his time also read  could gandhi assassination have been stopped  new film raises questionwe are deeply

subscribe nowwhy gandhi wanted to visit pakistangandhi s desire to visit pakistan should not entirely be seen in the violent political context of        . it is true that gandhi travelled to a number of riot affected places during this period primarily to restore peace. but  his proposal to visit cities such as lahore  rawalpindi and karachi after partition had a symbolic political value. gandhi often used his presence at areas of conflict as an unspoken political signal and critique.a look at gandhi s prayer meeting of    september      is relevant to understanding this.this meeting began with the recitation of holy books  including the quran. it was not an unusual practice in gandhian ashrams. but invoking islamic principles of peace and tolerance in a highly communalised environment was a radical move. gandhi  it seems  was aware of it. that was the reason why gandhi asked his audience whether anybody had any objection to the recitation from the quran. no one objected.gandhi then said what the muslims have done is not good  but what harm has the koran done  if one devotee of god commits a sin  shall we stop repeating his name   .if the devotees of god say that what the hindus have done is bad  does it also mean that the gita is bad  collected works of mahatma gandhi  vol.       july            september        p.     gandhi elaborated this point and added i want to go to lahore. i do not want to go with any police or military escort.  i want to go with faith and trust in the muslims there. let them kill me if they want.  let the government stop me if they will. but how can the government stop me  they will have to kill me if they want to stop me. if they kill me  my death will leave a lesson for you. collected works of mahatma gandhi  vol.       july            september        p.     this comment takes us to gandhi s known critique of modern civilisation  the nation state and the idea of representation.also read  why ghanaians are removing gandhi statuesnationality of an indianin hind swaraj  the seminal book that gandhi wrote in       he argued   india cannot cease to be one nation because people belonging to different religions live in it.  if the hindus believe that india should be peopled only by hindus  they are living in dream land.  in no part of the world are one nationality and one religion synonymous terms  nor has it ever been so in india   hind swaraj  navjivan        pp.       .the partition of india on a religious communal basis went against this core political belief of gandhi. the indian independence act      actually created two modern nation states india and pakistan. it was certainly in line with the muslim league s imagination of a muslim homeland  which gandhi had always opposed. but gandhi was also not very comfortable with the congress s uncritical acceptance of the western model of political institutions.although the nehru led congress adhered to the principle of  unity in diversity  in defining indian national identity  the approval of european style nation state as the determining structure of future indian polity was not compatible with gandhi s political thinking. the constituent assembly was all set to adopt the first past the post system of election and the parliamentary form of democracy.so  it was inevitable for him to challenge the emerging modern states of pakistan as well as india in his own unique ways. this might have been one of the reasons behind his enthusiasm to visit pakistan.he appeared confident that his powerful presence in the territory of pakistan without any  official security  would create an unprecedented impact not only on the displaced hindus and muslims  but also on the governments of the two states. there is a strong possibility that gandhi wished to use this opportunity to propose a radical plea for the re imagination and reconstruction of political institutions in the subcontinent.also read  pakistan doesn t give citizenship on religion  but india is dangerously tilting towards itnot to be a hindu qaidthe gandhi jinnah debate on the question of political representation is also very relevant to the question of gandhi s desire to visit pakistan. it is worth noting that jinnah s growth as the quaid e azam  the supreme leader  of muslims was contingent upon two related sets of arguments. first  muslims and hindus constitute two separate cultural nations and therefore  they should have two nation states. second  the muslim league is the sole representative of muslims  while the congress  led by gandhi  is a hindu party.gandhi never accepted this simplistic formulation. he always described himself as a proud hindu  yet he never asserted leadership as a hindu quaid.he remained doubtful about the western idea of representation itself. in his political thinking  representation of any community by a few nominated or even elected representatives cannot be an end in itself for achieving democratic participation of masses. he once remarked   if the national life becomes so perfect as to become self regulated  no representation is necessary.   harijan    december      gandhi s proposal to visit pakistan as a proud hindu is consistent with his critique of representation. his lifelong commitment to practicing his belief and ideas could have been tested and indeed achieved by practicing his version of hinduism in a  muslim homeland .after all  for him  practice was more important than ideas  my writings should be cremated with my body. what i have done will endure  not what i have said and written.

five things narendra modi and rahul gandhi should stop doing in     
text size  a  a ring out the old  dear leaders.as we enter the big election year  we re going to see  hear and think a lot about two people  narendra modi and rahul gandhi. no matter how much anyone tries otherwise  these two faces are going to personify the      campaign.here s a humble request to the two leaders to stop doing these things in     .narendra modi . stop blaming nehru  really  you re going to blame nehru for all your failures  nobody s buying it  not even your core congress hating hindutvawaadivoters. nehru didn t eat your homework and rahul gandhi is not even capable of eating it. leadership is about taking responsibility  not blaming dead predecessors. the more modi blames nehru  the more he reminds people about those who established the indian democracy. negative campaigning doesn t work in india. remember your own      campaign  . stop hiding and manipulating data  those not getting jobs won t feel better about it just because you ve stopped publishing unemployment data. by not counting farmer suicides  has narendra modi solved agrarian distress  and it s a matter of global shame that our gdp data is being questioned because the modi government keeps revising it to make it look better than the upa years. fake numbers don t hide reality. everyone knows we re going through a slowdown. in       let s come clean on economic data  ok  . stop using government agencies as a political tool  tax raids and court cases against opponents have become a joke  especially since they seem to target key opposition leaders just when their state is about to have an election. yes  the congress has done enough of this. but if you re such a political wizard modi ji  why not play on a level playing field  not just cbi  but myriad agencies have been let loose on the opposition and critics. as the      election nears  harassment of opposition leaders could backfire  making them look like martyrs.also read  in       rahul gandhi set the agenda   and narendra modi followedwe are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe now . stop destroying institutional autonomy  democracy is not just about elections. it s also about autonomous institutions that help run a country smoothly. be it the reserve bank of india or the central bureau of investigation  be it the central information commission or the non existent lokpal  the modi government has done its best to destroy institutional autonomy. the concentration of power in the pmo does not augur well for democracy. let s stop being so power hungry in       please  . stop looking at the camera  you are the prime minister. the camera follows you. you don t have to follow the camera. stop being so obsessed with producing beautiful pictures. don t change your designer kurtas three times a day. do great work and all eyes will follow you anyway.rahul gandhi . stop making gaffes  the single biggest reason why rahul gandhi still doesn t have wide acceptability as a leader is his gaffes. when he says kumbhakaran instead of kumbha ram  he sounds like he knows neither about kumbhkaran nor kumbha ram and that he doesn t even know why the gaffe is funny. the gaffes remind people that rahul gandhi isn t smart enough to lead the country.  here s why modi s gaffes don t cost him as much.  . stop taking so many foreign holidays  you can t position yourself as the leader of the poor  the underprivileged  the marginalised and the downtrodden when you take frequent foreign holidays. as it is rahul gandhi is seen as a deracinated leader who doesn t understand what it really is like to be an ordinary indian. it s not a rare thing. rahul gandhi jets off to another world several times a year  often with or without excuse. why does he have to  have to  have to go abroad on his birthday and new year s eve also read  talkpoint  does rahul gandhi get the timing of his foreign visits mostly wrong  . stop doing rafale  rafale  the rafale controversy had its moment. it helped rahul gandhi put the bjp on the back foot  but only at the level of the national media. that was good enough. the issue did not resonate much with the people. now that the supreme court has ended the controversy  rahul gandhi needs to retire it. whether or not there was a rafale scam  the story is over. let s move on. . stop thinking you re a mass leader  rahul gandhi gets the credit for winning rajasthan  madhya pradesh and chhattisgarh because they were won under his leadership   just as he gets the blame for the elections the congress has lost under his watch. yet rahul can at best take credit for the strategies. voters voted against the bjp  and at best for the farm loan waivers  but not for rahul gandhi. it will help rahul gandhi do well in      if he stops thinking he s a mass leader. fewer rallies would mean fewer gaffes. enabling his people and alliance partners to win from behind the scenes would suit him better. . stop saying bhaiyya and rolling your sleeves  short sleeves or full  decide what suits you. rolling up one s sleeves can be a sign of preparing for combat. but if they keep falling back and you keep rolling them up  you re the opposite of combat ready. you re a man who s not in control of things. also  let s please stop saying  dekho bhaiyya . it doesn t sound authentic. you grew up in lutyens  delhi  not lakhimpur kheri  and everyone knows that.also read  the defining

in       rahul gandhi set the agenda   and narendra modi followed
text size  a  a after six long years  the congress began to set the political agenda again.the congress president is not even trying to win the next lok sabha elections   this writer had said on   july. on    july  congress president rahul gandhi surprised prime minister narendra modi by hugging him in the lok sabha  stealing what was to be a modi victory against the first no confidence motion in    years. in one photo  the hug symbolises what suddenly changed  rahul gandhi started at least trying to win.for the first four years of its term  the modi government and the bharatiya janata party  bjp  managed to set the political agenda nationally  as well in the states. in politics  whoever sets the agenda gets to dominate the political mood. and the bjp was going largely unchallenged in this game.in february       bihar chief minister nitish kumar  then a congress ally  had publicly complained the opposition was unable to set the agenda and urged rahul gandhi to take the lead in doing so. this was at least partly the reason why nitish kumar swapped allies and returned to the nda in july     .also read  what will narendra modi do if he is not pm in      as we ring out      and

also set the national agenda for the moment  farm distress.and narendra modi has been forced to respond to it. in his speeches in himachal pradesh and uttar pradesh last week  the prime minister said the congress had been fooling farmers on the issue of farm loan waivers. yes  narendra modi remains the best orator out there. his numerous claims about the congress  poor performance on farm loan waivers could damage the congress  effort to use this plank in the      general elections. but the fact is  the congress is setting the agenda  something it didn t seem capable of doing from      to

farm distress as a major issue before the lok sabha elections due in four months  as of now  he is complaining there is too much negative news. please look at the positive news websites  he recommends to the nation.the modi government is said to be considering several options to address farm distress even as we speak. until now  it had come across as deliberately ignoring the issue. the government s outlay for agriculture is likely to go up in the interim  election year budget.this is in marked contrast with the past  when rahul gandhi had campaigned on the farm distress issue in uttar pradesh

and the supreme court ended the dispute anyway.but the rafale controversy was an opportunity cost for the bjp. it put the party on the back foot. the bjp didn t know how to respond  at times saying it would not speak on the issue and at other times offering lengthy explanations. at least  at the level of the delhi media narrative  the rafale issue affected modi s ability to steal the headlines in his favour.the tables have been turned  the congress is making modi look weak and defensive. rahul gandhi is now playing to win  except that modi is a veteran at the game. twenty nineteen promises to

why rss is doing to modi what congress did to manmohan singh the accidental pm
text size  a  a the current nda regime is no less hamstrung by an alternate power centre.the bharatiya janata party  bjp  has been gloating over the accidental prime minister  a vijay ratnakar gutte directed film on former prime minister manmohan singh s tenure. the ruling party  in a tweet  described the movie as a  riveting tale of how a family held the country to ransom for    long years. many wouldn t argue with the bjp on the verity of the dual power centres during the upa regime  which left it riven and tottering.narendra modi is not an accidental prime minister  his predecessor singh was. but the current nda regime is no less hamstrung by an alternate power centre that is  the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh  rss   the bjp s ideological fountainhead.the rss imprint on governance is  however  taken for granted and evokes little outrage because the prime minister and many of his cabinet colleagues are self certified former sangh pracharaks and volunteers. the usual reaction

gatekeepers posted in ministers  offices serve as the eyes and ears of the rss in the corridors of power.a similar system of gatekeeping has been replicated in chief ministers  offices in states where the bjp is in power. himachal pradesh chief minister jairam thakur  say bjp leaders from the state  was given a list with names of a political secretary  a media adviser and two officers on special duty  osds  by rss leaders in delhi for their posting in the cmo. he had no option but to comply. rajat sethi  a close aide of bjp general secretary and rss leader ram madhav  was appointed political

as the world debates racist gandhi  african americans had yearned for a black gandhi
text size  a  a no one who studies gandhi should defend his views on race and caste  but that doesn t make him less of an important figure.mohandas karamchand gandhi is taking quite a beating of late. a book from south africa accuses him of racism. his statue has been brought down in ghana. the internet is aflame with debate over gandhi s attitude towards africa and the african people.years ago  i wrote a historical essay called  black gandhi    about gandhi s sojourn in south africa and what  gandhi  meant for the black struggle in the americas and in africa.as early as       the pan africanist intellectual and militant w.e.b. du bois asked gandhi to contribute some thoughts for his pan africanist magazine  the crisis. in a note that appeared with gandhi s comments  du bois wrote   agitation  non violence  refusal to cooperate with the oppressor  became gandhi s watchword and with it he is leading all india to freedom. here and today he stretches his hand in fellowship to his coloured friends of the west. it was a time when several young radical african american civil rights fighters yearned for their own black gandhi.also read  ram guha is wrong. gandhi went from a racist young man to a racist middle aged manit was this gandhi   with his insistence on non violence   who captured the imagination of colonised people from one end of the world to another. it was this gandhi who enthused a young martin luther king  jr. in the united states to adopt techniques borrowed from india  and it was this method that inspired the      defiance campaign in south africa.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowbut much of this contradicts recent scholarship. the issue now is gandhi s use of the word  kaffir  and his derogatory comments against black africans that are scattered through his voluminous collected works. serial quotations are produced that show that his views were vile. the rubble of his fallen statue in ghana is seen as a first salvo in a protracted struggle to rub his reputation into the dust.a victim of racism himself   half naked fakir   churchill called him   gandhi had no clear vocabulary to attack british racism. in fact  bourgeois indian nationalism had no such vocabulary.however  this wasn t the first challenge to gandhi.for indians  gandhi s limitations on the issue of caste have been apparent for long and well documented. even towards the end of his life  he was not keen to smash the hierarchy of caste  as i wrote in my book untouchable freedom   on the balmiki community  amongst whom gandhi lived when he was in delhi. the silence on caste and race runs the gamut across the leaders and intellectuals of bourgeois indian nationalism.apart from the writings of ambedkar and periyar and a host of others who are less well known  no major bourgeois indian nationalist wrote a text that eviscerated caste hierarchies. jawaharlal nehru s discovery of india        is mute on caste  although it was nehru who invited the author of annihilation of caste   dr b.r. ambedkar   to draft the indian constitution. that was a sign that he grasped the problem  something utterly alien to the hindutva tradition that valorised the caste system even more than gandhi did.but on race  their silence is virtually complete. in       humayun kabir joined the unesco panel to smash the idea of race    all men belong to the same species   the panel wrote. but there was no version of aim  cesaire s discourse on colonialism         nor was there a version of frantz fanon s black skin  white masks       . anti racist consciousness was simply not well developed in india. it remains a problem.also read  why ghanaians are removing gandhi statues in the middle of the nightno one who studies gandhi should defend his views on race and caste. it is not enough to say that gandhi was a man of his times. many people in his times took strong  public positions against both race and caste hierarchies. gandhi s temperament was conservative. overthrowing social hierarchies troubled him.and yet this does not make gandhi any less of an important figure in the anti colonial movement. it was gandhi who turned bourgeois nationalism in india towards the peasantry and helped build the basis for a protracted mass struggle             that broke the back of british imperialism.gandhi the real man disappears into gandhi the myth. this took place not after gandhi s death  but during his life. he inspired people from one end of asia to the other end of the americas to fight against colonialism and all that it stood for. it is impossible to take that away from the historical record  that feat of inspiring the world with a simple message  we refuse to listen to you. but myths are always dangerous. beneath them are real people  and real people are prone to be disappointing. for years now  biographers have pulled out all kinds of elements in gandhi s life that make the sensitive person uneasy. scrutiny of the kind given to gandhi will necessarily tarnish the myth.also read  gandhi does not need statues and ghana does not need advice on what to do with themall these debates are important. no person is saintly. no one should be worshipped. more important than gandhi were the freedom movement in india and the freedom movement in south africa and the freedom movement in the united states and elsewhere. leaders   such as gandhi   play a key role in these movements  but they do not define them. it would be a pity if in this auto da f  of gandhi s  reputation  the complexity of his role is forgotten and the movements that he inspired are set aside. the myth is dangerous if it obscures the important voices that tried to be heard during gandhi s lifetime  notably the people who were not content with  flag nationalism   with the replacement of the british flag with the flag of the indian bourgeoisie.the author is the chief editor of leftword books  new delhi  india . his essay black gandhi was first published in the marxist journal  social scientist  and then elaborated for a book on  black internationalism .subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis   only you can fix it you are

ramachandra guha is wrong. gandhi went from a racist young man to a racist middle aged man
text size  a  a there is a reason why ghanaians protested the gandhi statue and said  gandhimustfall.there is enough textual evidence to back the scholarly claim that mohandas karamchand gandhi was racist. according to indian political historian ramachandra guha   by the time he was in his mid   s  gandhi no longer spoke of africans as inferior to indians. to debunk this demonstrably false assertion by guha  we will take a brief look at gandhi s writings from his mid to late   s and early to mid   s up to the time of his departure from umzantsi afrika  south africa   and see if they qualify him to be called an anti afrikan anti black racist.many people across the world who previously admired gandhi and hailed him as a  mahatma   great soul  may be experiencing what is called  cognitive dissonance   the mental conflict that occurs when beliefs or assumptions are contradicted by new information . this psychological state has been induced by what i call  impropagandhi   improper propaganda about gandhi .also read  gandhi does not need statues and ghana does not need advice on what to do with them those who suffer from cognitive dissonance reject  explain away  or avoid new information  persuade themselves that no conflict really exists  reconcile the differences  or resort to any other defensive means of preserving stability or order in their conceptions of the world and of themselves.  if this describes you  keep reading.from guha s article  we can ascertain at least one of three possibilities. that guha we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowdoes not know much about mohandas karamchand gandhi. is intentionally lying about mohandas karamchand gandhi  in true gandhian fashion . is unable to do simple arithmetic.mohandas karamchand gandhi was born on   october      .in gandhi s autobiography  the reader is conned via impropagandhi into believing that gandhi had a life changing epiphany and transformation in           thus brahmacharya which i had been observing willynilly since       was sealed with a vow in the middle of     .  satyagraha in south africa  navajivan publishing house ahmedabad       reprint. by m. gandhi   v. g. desai.       pp.      . with this supposed epiphany in mind  let s take a quick look at a sample of gandhi s views on afrikan black people immediately before that vow at the age of       may       it was a gross injustice to seek to place indians in the same class as the kaffirs.  vol. v. the collected works of mahatma gandhi  electronic book   vol.    volumes . new delhi  publications division government of india  p.      kaffir  is an extremely derogatory term used to describe the indigenous afrikan black people of umzantsi afrika  south africa   and gandhi was aware that the term was as derogatory as the term  coolie   which was applied to indians and to which he took much offence  see willem adolf joubert and t. johan scott       . the law of south africa  vol.  . cape town berea  butterworths  pp.        . .   may       thanks to the court s decision  only clean indians or coloured people other than kaffirs can now travel by the trams.  cwmg. vol. v  p.     now let s take a brief look at gandhi s views on black people after his supposed transformation  which ostensibly occurred in the middle of        november       boer leaders     should not consider indians as being on the same level as kaffirs.  cwmg  vol. vi  p.        november        t he boer mind     refused to recognize the evident and sharp distinctions that undoubtedly exist between british indians and the kaffir races in south africa.  cwmg. vol. vi  p.       july       if registration is made compulsory  there will be no difference between indians and kaffirs   cwmg. vol. vii  p.        december       the indian of the transvaal     is indiscriminately dubbed  coolie.  one hears even in official circles such expressions as  coolie lawyer    coolie doctor    coolie merchant.  his women are  coolie marys.    he is even denied the not always obvious privilege of riding in the same municipal tramcars and government railway carriages as his white fellow colonists. his children are afforded no facilities for education except they attend the schools set apart for kaffirs.  cwmg. vol. vii  pp.           emphasis added we cannot but point out the double standard in gandhi s laments at being called a coolie  while in the next breath he descends to calling afrikan black people  kaffirs . this is when gandhi was    years old.   december       compulsory registration is recognised as signifying nothing less than the reduction of british indians to the status of the kaffir.  cwmg. vol. vii  p.     july         kaffirs are as a rule uncivilised   the convicts even more so. they are troublesome  very dirty and live almost like animals.     the reader can easily imagine the plight of the poor indian thrown into such company   cwmg vol. viii  p.       february       the british rulers take us to be so lowly and ignorant that they assume that  like the kaffirs who can be pleased with toys and pins  we can also be fobbed off with trinkets.  cwmg. vol. viii  p.       march       many of the native prisoners are only one degree removed from the animal and often created rows and fought among themselves in their cells.  cwmg. vol. viii  p.       july       we were then marched off to a prison intended for kaffirs. there  our garments were stamped with the letter  n   which meant that we were being classed with the natives. we were all prepared for hardships  but not quite for this experience. we could understand not being classed with the whites  but to be placed on the same level with the natives seemed too much to put up with. cwmg. vol. viii  p.        march       there is nothing for it but to let ourselves be classed with the kaffirs and starve.  cwmg. vol. viii  pp.           january       i observed with regret that some indians were happy to sleep in the same room as the kaffirs     we may entertain no aversion to kaffirs  but we cannot ignore the fact that there is no common ground between them and us in the daily affairs of life.  cwmg. vol. ix  p.        january       i have  though  resolved in my mind on an agitation to ensure that indian prisoners are not lodged with kaffirs or others.  cwmg. vol. ix  p.     the next quote is a brief look at gandhi s role in supporting a multi level caste like strain of apartheid in the prisons in south africa. he was    when he wrote this    january        t here was urgent need for separate lavatories for indians. i also told him that indian prisoners should never be lodged with kaffirs. the governor immediately issued an order for a lavatory for indians to be sent on from the central gaol.  cwmg. vol. ix  p.        january       first  why should we bear such hardships  submit ourselves  for instance  to the restrictions of gaol life  wear coarse and ungainly dress  eat food which is hardly food  starve ourselves  suffer being kicked by the warder  live among the kaffirs     better die than suffer this   cwmg. vol. ix  p.       emphasis added also read  why ghanaians are removing gandhi statues in the middle of the nightagain  we see the blatant  coolie kaffir  hypocrisy in the following quote by gandhi    july       we were locked up with the kaffirs. there was not a single european officer who described us as indians. we were called  sammies  or  coolies . cwmg. vol. x  p.      emphasis added   october       we do not get there the food that we are used to  and are classified with the kaffirs.  cwmg. vol. x  p.     it should be noted at this point that gandhi lived till    and at the time of the preceding quote  he was     making him middle aged  and certainly not in his mid   s as asserted by guha . those who suffer from impropagandhi induced cognitive dissonance  who say he was only an anti black anti afrikan racist when he was  young   are being quite disingenuous. let s continue   december       some indians do have contacts with kaffir women. i think such contacts are fraught with grave danger. indians would do well to avoid them altogether.  cwmg. vol. x  p.        march       if the regulations provide for kaffir police  we can fight the regulations.  cwmg. vol. xi  p.        october       i saw it reported that we might even ask the kaffirs to strike. but such is not our intention at all.  cwmg. vol xiii  p.     this quote was the year before gandhi left umzantsi afrika  south africa  for india  where he turned his attention to robbing the dalits   the black untouchables of india   of the double vote and special electorates. why does ramachandra guha fail to mention all this  was this out of ignorance or malevolence in our chapter entitled  the pro indo aryan  anti black m.k. gandhi and ghana s  gandhi must fall movement   in the book rhodes must fall  oxford   we focus on the consistency of gandhi s pro indo aryan and anti afrikan anti black actions throughout his life in umzantsi afrika  south africa . his subsequent disagreements in india with babasaheb ambedkar on the demand for the rights of the dalits are a continuation of his earlier anti black racist life.also  it should be noted that racism   like varnasrama dharma  caste ism    is systemic  and as such  the concrete actions that perpetuate these systems should not be reduced to the idea that it simply consists of saying mean things. from gandhi s role in instituting caste like apartheid and segregation at the durban post office  telegraph office  and in the jails  to his agitating for military training and firearms to use against the amazulu alongside his  white fellow colonists  at the time of the bambatha rebellion  which he later lied about in his autobiography   to the coercion induced poona pact disenfranchising the dalits  gandhi s pro indo aryan  anti black racist actions are clear cut  straightforward and inexcusable.further  and more significantly  gandhi pales  no pun intended  in comparison to the afrikan black heroes and heroines that we could  would  and should choose for ourselves   if we even had the chance to learn about them   based on the principle of self determination as opposed to external imposition via coercion.also read  this leader forced mahatma gandhi to change his views on casteadditionally  if this is to be a serious conversation  it would be useful if those who suffer from impropagandhi induced cognitive dissonance cease and desist from dragging out that tired list of afrikans blacks who gandhi successfully duped with impropagandhi simply because they did not have the opportunity to research and read his collected works.finally  i would also like to express solidarity with the dalits   the black untouchables of india   who have suffered under the pale white yoke of indo aryan oppression for centuries. indeed  the struggle for black dignity  self respect and self determination continues worldwide. this is

studies  university of ghana. he was also a part of the  gandhimustfall protest.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis   only you can fix it you are reading this

unlike anti congressism  anti bjpism is still to ripen in     
text size  a  a      election is going to be all about electoral sanity versus electoral vanity.as it becomes clear that the next lok sabha elections will be announced in march  there is a rush to build coalition alliances. rahul gandhi s congress party has decided to form working fronts in each state  stitching together a larger national front against the bjp for the      elections. bjp president amit shah s strategy  it seems  is to not let such a front emerge or break it wherever it evolves.the enforcement agencies have gone into overdrive. and that is a sign of political blackmail and muscle flexing  since many leaders fear that they are under their lens. fear is the key  to quote alistair maclean rather out of context.the political equations have been simplified into an  either you are with us or against us  binary. in the next    days  the fence sitters will have to decide either way. those who cannot decide soon enough  the enforcement agencies will ensure they hurry. both the bjp as well as the congress are showing openness in making new friends.also read  stop counting state by state.      will be a national electionintense speculation on whether narendra modi will become the prime minister again has already begun. the political market is giving the bjp anywhere between     and     seats. if the party gets     seats  there is no chance for a new nda to emerge and the bjp mps will not let modi lead the parliamentary party. however  if he gets around     seats  he will create a new nda and become the pm. with     seats  he is unchallenged  goes the speculative math.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our

and i say remove poverty   modi will stun india and the world with a grand victory. it is a cocktail of hope  hype  logic and faith.index of opposition disunitybut the fact is that the bjp mps are becoming more vocal  though privately  against modi. therefore  the three questions frequently raised are  what are the options left before him to again  mesmerise  the electorate  and what are chances of the opposition coming together  the third question posed ad nauseam  of course  is who will be their pm therefore  it is necessary to go into the question of the index of opposition unity  as well as the index of opposition disunity.how do the parties ally with each other and how are the fronts formed  what differentiates them and which features bring them together. almost all regional or small parties  in both current as well as prospective fronts  have at some time or the other been anti congress or anti bjp.also read  bjp mps are complaining about narendra modi amit shah style        is around the cornerboth the dmk and the aiadmk have been strong allies of the congress or the bjp at one time or the other. ideologically  both the dravidian parties are like tweedledum and tweedledee. same is true for the shiv sena and raj thackeray s maharashtra navnirman sena  mns . and yet their hostility towards each other is deep.the bjp and the shiv sena are allies  but are mostly engaged in virulent  internecine fights with each other. both the shiv sena and the mns are harsh critics of narendra modi today but were great admirers of him three years ago. modi and shah have always been indifferent  if not inimical towards the shiv sena. that is why the question of how parties form alliances and fronts becomes intriguing.janata party and its collapseonly two parties have fought consistently against each other   the congress and the bjp. there have been defections. the bjp was not a party to reckon with till     . its earlier incarnation was the jana sangh  and any association with it was considered a political blasphemy.ideology had united them  but politics divided their hindu bonhomie. the bjp and the jana sangh could never work under one banner. the nda could bring into its fold a visceral critic like george fernandes  but not its own hindu brothers   the jana sangh or the hindu mahasabha. it is  therefore  clear that similar ideologies and belief systems do not necessarily bring two parties together into an alliance.indeed  the janata party  mentored by jayaprakash narayan  had four diverse partners. the congress  o   the swatantra party  the jana sangh and one of the socialist parties. the janata party came to power in       defeating the emergency regime of indira gandhi. but the jp led party was divided on the question of the jana sangh s participation in the janata party. jp had brought in the sangh parivar  stating that they should be part of the mainstream politics. it is wrong for the progressives  jp used to say  to question their patriotic and nationalist credentials.but that certificate of nationalist morality could not help the sangh parivar. the socialist faction of the janata party demanded that the jana sangh must severe its relationship with the rss. the jana sangh was not prepared to do that. the janata party was split and the government collapsed. the grand alliance of the janata party could not survive the ideological political contradictions. the janata party devolved over time into multiple factions and parties.the rashtriya janata dal  the janata dal  secular   the janata dal  united   the indian national lok dal  inld   the rashtriya lok dal  rld   the lok janshakti party  ljp   the samajwadi party  and  of course  the bharatiya janata party  bjp  are siblings of the lohiates and jayaprakash ites. there is no trace of the original janata party today  which was credited for launching a second freedom movement in the country and defeating the indira rule. the lone surviving soldier of the

bjp has a family problem and it s not gandhi nehru
text size  a  a amit shah rendered bjp workers irrelevant  and they will come back to bite him in     .the bjp has a crisis brewing at home. its mps  mlas  leaders and workers are all getting disillusioned and carping. and so are many of its allies who once helped the party shed its image of being a brahmin bania organisation.on    december  two days after the party s defeat in madhya pradesh  chhattisgarh and rajasthan  bjp president amit shah held a meeting with office bearers in new delhi. a backbencher whispered to his colleagues sitting close by   hamaari party ki haar hui hai  lekin karyakartaon ki jeet hui hai  our party has lost but the workers have won .  they giggled in muffled tones.it changed into wry smiles soon  as shah skirted the reasons for the defeat and meandered  talking about peshwas and the battle of panipat that paved the way for the british rule in the country. therefore  the party must win the      lok sabha elections  he said  and drew comparisons with the battle of panipat.also read  bjp mps are complaining about narendra modi amit shah style        is around the cornerbarely four months to go before the next battle  shah should be worried about his army. the party leader who snickered about the victory of workers even as the bjp lost madhya pradesh at the    december meeting was referring to the near irrelevance of workers in the party s scheme of things. the common gripe among the bjp s mps and mlas today is that the workers are tired of carrying out instructions from the top without getting anything in return.so  if you visited the rajasthan bjp headquarters in jaipur during elections  you would be struck by its deserted look. the bjp workers in other states haven t been very happy either. while they are supposed to  ask not what the country  read the party  has given you   they have no say in the party s decision making process.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and

practice  ensuring that everyone from the top to the bottom had a piece of the pie. under the bjp regime  everything is seen to be concentrated at the top  with even the mps and the mlas complaining of having no say in the party and the government.four bjp mps left the party in the last one year   nana patole from maharashtra  thupstan chhewang from jammu   kashmir  harish chandra meena from

to be a fighting fit election machine but the vital cogs seem to be shaky now.there is disquiet in the larger nda umbrella  too. after the departure of chandrababu naidu s tdp and upendra kushwaha s rlsp  some more constituents are showing signs of fraying. chirag paswan of the lok janshakti party has suddenly become critical of the bjp s ram temple agenda. it s not for nothing that his father  union minister ram vilas paswan  is considered the weatherman of indian politics. he may continue in the nda but is said to be unhappy with the  crisis of conviction  in the saffron party.also read

bjp strategists do not seem much concerned about allies leaving the nda. upendra kushwaha was sending desperate signals to the bjp for negotiations but amit shah couldn t spare time to give him an appointment. om prakash rajbhar of the suheldev bharatiya samaj party  a part of the government in uttar pradesh  has been publicly airing his grievances against the bjp  but he has failed to attract shah s attention. the bjp s equations with other nda constituents are not great either.also read  talkpoint  has bjp s big brother attitude damaged nda beyond repair if the bjp insiders are to be

now. in a modi versus rahul gandhi or a modi versus the rest contest that      election could be  the results would be determined by the popularity of an individual.but if there is one lesson that the

both bjp and congress are complicit in expanding state surveillance without legal basis
text size  a  a an mha order authorises    central agencies to intercept  monitor  and decrypt information.both the bjp and the congress have placed the responsibility on the other for the recent ministry of home affairs  surveillance order. both are somewhat right  which means that both have a great deal to answer for. the order authorises    central agencies to intercept  monitor  and decrypt information without explaining the extent of such powers.the expected criticism of this order has been the state s vast and potentially unbridled power over private communications. in response  the government has defended the measure on grounds of transparency. as per the government s logic  the order gives us details of which agencies are involved rather than this matter remaining in the dark. it has also clarified that other safeguards  namely those present in the information technology  it  act       read with the it  procedure and safeguards for interception  monitoring and decryption of information  rules        would continue to apply.also read   modi sarkar to stalker sarkar   oppn slams govt over its  snoop  orderalthough the political debate has focused on who is responsible for this order   whether the bjp or the congress   this is beside the point. the real question is how  in an age of big data  legislation authorising the interception of communications should be framed so as to safeguard individual rights. the original sin is doubtlessly an existing provision in section    of the it act. this provision  although problematic even in its initial form in the      act  was substantially enlarged during a      amendment.although the provision has never been constitutionally challenged  it is hard to see how it could survive such a challenge. the provision overreaches constitutional exceptions  such as security of the state and public order  to cover interception as necessary for preventing incitement to the committing of any cognizable offence and for the investigation of any offence. these broad justifications raise the possibility that this provision could become a vehicle for mass surveillance  going beyond case by case assessment and targeted action. this apprehension must be gauged alongside the reality of india s central monitoring system  already in place in respect of telecom data  which processes huge amounts of metadata and offers immense surveillance possibilities.moreover  the provision gives a carte blanche to the union to prescribe procedures and safeguards that determine its discretion. the union  as one might expect  came up with few limitations on its own power while drafting the      interception rules  by and large following the directives of the supreme court in pucl          a case against personalised telephone tapping that was never meant to guarantee effective protection against big data surveillance.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowalso read  modi govt  snoop  order was upa s idea  and was backed by most partiesthe interception rules formalised an ad hoc bureaucratic review committee that evaluated interception requests after the act of interception had already taken place. rule   was particularly problematic  expanding the scope of interception to cover computer resources likely to be used for the generation  transmission  receipt  or storage of information  including that relating to any subject  from or to any set of premises. thus  no realistic geographic or subject matter boundaries existed to provide checks on the exercise of power. under the interception rules  intermediaries that fail to assist with interception requests would attract penal liability of up to seven years of imprisonment. this ensured that intermediaries would accede to most interception requests without second guessing the rationale.this problematic structure that gives wide powers to the state  that provides for no independent review  and that incentivises over compliance on the part of intermediaries  is made notably worse by the new order. in vesting authorities such as the narcotics control bureau  enforcement directorate  department of revenue intelligence and the central board of direct taxes with the power to intercept  monitor  and decrypt  the union government reveals its intent to enlist actors that wield extensive powers on a more daily basis  and in respect of more routine matters  and make them surveillance foot soldiers on the pretext of investigating an offence or preventing incitement to its commission.considering online intermediaries are already vulnerable to over compliance  the privacy threat is amplified when the request comes from agencies that impact their daily business. moreover  the nature of agency surveillance is such that each agency builds on the data already in its hands. the taxman may have some suspicion of tax fraud and based on this subjective knowledge could request for information that has no real connection with the probe  as no safeguards exist to weed out such requests before they are made. the real effect of this order  therefore  is to enhance intermediary compliance with interception requests that are otherwise unlawful  and at a scale that would qualify as mass  rather than targeted  surveillance due to the wide variety of agencies enlisted for the task.also read  on privacy  supreme court s aadhaar verdict doesn t even engage with the concernsboth section    and the new order raise serious constitutional challenges. this is especially so after the supreme court s decisions on privacy and aadhaar. in the latter  the court insisted on judicial oversight when aadhaar data is sought   and in that case  the grounds are much more tightly confined to national security interests.digital surveillance under the it act needs a similar re examination  both in the light of these judicial developments and because of the new concerns raised in the big data age. by blaming one another  both the bjp and the congress are shifting the entire responsibility on the other for section    and the new order. in reality  both sides are complicit in an extraordinary aggrandisement of state power

let s ask why our former pm let congress undermine his authority and that of his office
text size  a  a shekhar gupta asks why former pm manmohan singh let congress undermine his authority and that of his office.in his first conversation with pervez musharraf  manmohan singh gave the general a professorial tutorial on exercise of state power. you and i are both accidental leaders of our nations  he said. we were not expected to reach where we have. which musharraf could have disputed  as anybody who gets commission as an officer in pakistan s army knows he is a candidate for the top office  and we don t know if he did. but  to get back to serious stuff  the professor told the general that holding public office is like public trust. you can t have it  and do nothing with it. his point  therefore  was  let s get a move on with the peace process  whatever our respective political capital. how close the two coincidental  if not accidental  leaders got to an agreement has now been revealed quite authoritatively  and notably  by former pakistani foreign minister khurshid kasuri. for more details  wait for his forthcoming book.it s a question i wish singh had asked himself at various points in his second term when his party     janpath and its commissars persistently destroyed his authority. they ruined his name and legacy  and diminished the prime minister s office so much that a disgusted electorate turned to narendra modi for his promise of an all powerful pmo  gujarat style. but while there is no alibi for his in house tormentors  i wonder if he sometimes also repeated to himself the line he had spoken to musharraf. if he actually believed public office was public trust  did he do enough to justify it in his second innings  or did he fail the test he had himself set for national leaders let me first get disclosures and disclaimers out of the way. i was an admirer of singh  and continue to be one. he gave me the gift of time and trust that we journalists value. in my own writings and in the newspaper i then edited  his economic and foreign policies  particularly the nuclear deal  found robust support. in his quiet power struggle with the party i weighed in on his side  believing that only he  among top congress leaders  had the combination of intellectual  moral and tina  there is no alternative  clout to save us from a return to rotten povertarian socialism.since i am old fashioned and do not accept the new  norms  where off record conversations are revealed  confidences not kept and sources betrayed  and with self righteousness  i will not reveal whatever he may have shared with me during our many conversations. but i will reveal one point i once made to him  cheekily  saying that history will blame him for many things  but give him no credit for the bad things he saved us from in a political set up where awful new ideas floated twice a week. he shrugged me off then  with disapproval. but now  as he prepares to go to court  accused of corruption and criminal breach of trust  he will reflect on the amount of time  energy and political capital he lost fighting these bad ideas  stalling or diluting them to minimise the damage  as with nrega  right to education and food bills. on land acquisition  he lost out fully as rahul had been convinced by his kautilyas this was his party s ticket to a third term.in these five years there were many junctures when he could have drawn the line. the first blow was his party repudiating the agreement he reached with his pakistani counterpart at sharm el sheikh to resume the dialogue process suspended after      . it was the first time in our history that a party had vetoed its own prime minister on a key foreign policy issue  and in public. he fretted to close aides over his environment minister writing letters to him on controversial issues taking a line at variance with his  and leaking them so he would  read them in newspapers  first. his do nothing defence minister wouldn t listen to him  not moving on purchases  slowing progress  including joint exercises with the us  and once most notably in early      invoking  higher ups  to veto a decision so important for national security it could have only been the prime minister s and cabinet committee on security s.his party s old ideologies came back to blight him on economics as well as foreign policy. through these    years  there was hardly any top level exchange with israel  although it continued to be akey strategic ally in those years. in the aftermath of        p. chidambaram was forced to cancel us and israel visits for fear of  political implications   read muslim vote . and as worries grew with the economic slowdown  not only did pranab mukherjee  the last statist  refuse to listen to him on the retrospective tax  he even dismissed his plea that the rbi governor  then d. subbarao  be nudged to cut rates. you ask him  you gave him a two year extension  not i  he is believed to have said in the presence of a couple of senior economic officials before walking off.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowsonia and her advisers started the practice of writing letters to him on populist issues and making them public. this had a twin objective  to give the family credit for all  pro poor  policies and to distance them from anything vaguely risky or reformist. he wasn t allowed to pick his people in the pmo  forced to drop his loyal media adviser  and while it is simplistic to say that files were taken to sonia  key decisions  even bureaucratic appointments  were cleared with her. lutyens  zone is brutal  like the core of any capital city. once it figures where the power rests  the rest don t matter  whatever their designations.his admirers  including this columnist  watched his frustration as he allowed himself to diminish in moral stature and political authority  becoming the butt of nasty jokes.when rahul tore up in public that corruption ordinance while singh was overseas  we had hoped that this was enough humiliation. but he disappointed his admirers  who watched in frustration as he declined  going into silences  refusing to say anything in public on key issues as if in a sulk or self pity. and i can promise you that he is not inarticulate. far from it. his last televised full interview was with me  in the run up to the      elections  and he spoke with passion  intellect and conviction. he was no  maun mohan . in his first term  he showed flashes of it  as on the nuclear deal. in the second  he was on a maun vrat  undermining himself  his government and his party.why did he give up his moral and constitutional authority without a fight  he confessed often that he was an appointed prime minister  not an elected one. but then why did he not insist that he contest for lok sabha  particularly in       i think his party bosses were quite happy to see him that way  a bureaucrat like  compliant prime minister serving at their sufferance. but if he had insisted that to have real authority he had to be in the house of the people  his party would have been compelled to give him a safe seat  much as it may have preferred to keep him a bonsai.it is useful to look at what the scholar moises naim  currently at carnegie and formerly editor in chief of foreign policy magazine  says in his book the end of power  from boardrooms to battlefields and churches to states  why being in charge isn t what it used to be. the world over  he says   power no longer buys as much as it used to   power is eroding. it is easier to get  but harder to use and easy to lose. further  with    hour tv  social media and the tyranny of real time   power players now often pay a steeper and more immediate price for their mistakes . flush with its victory on the nuclear deal  the upa won its second  much larger mandate in     . then began the spiral of mistakes  compounded by singh retreating without a fight. his power  authority and political capital now were lost rapidly  as naim explains. by      he was a lame duck. unless the terms of engagement were changed to restore his basic authority  he should have threatened to quit. my belief is sonia and rahul would have relented. they were not about to trust pranab with the job. that he chose not to do so is the real disappointment and it is worth exploring why.j.n.  mani  dixit was his first pick as national security adviser. he never tired of telling me that he had served with every pm in india s history and that manmohan singh was the most selfless of all. dixit passed away  sadly  early in his tenure or we would have had the benefit of his insights as to why singh did not stand up for his office. as we watch the tragedy of our most self effacing  clean and intellectual prime minister walking in and out of the courtroom  we have to ask him a rough question  did he himself flunk the test he had set for musharraf  if he treated public office as public trust  he wouldn t have let it be undermined. if he didn t  did he then put his feudal loyalties to the family above that public trust  did he think he must not embarrass the family  whatever the cost to me and my office  he probably did. and though not even his worst enemies would believe the court will finally find anything on him  and i still think history will judge him more kindly than journalism  he will also be remembered as a great leader and patriot who denied himself real greatness by putting his feudal loyalty above the diktat of public trust.this article was originally published in     .subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis   only you can fix it you are reading this because you

rahul gandhi s dream team is made of old people
text size  a  a the young leaders in the congress who have delivered or shown the potential are falling by the wayside.thirty three years back  in june       then prime minister rajiv gandhi had got the entire nation cheering for him as he spoke at the us congress       miles away   india is an old country but a young nation  and like the young everywhere we are impatient. i am impatient and i too have a dream .cut to december     . his son and congress president rahul gandhi is now speaking of the young nation s dream again. but he has a different message for the young colleagues in his old party   the two powerful warriors are patience and time. so as kamal nath and ashok gehlot take oath as chief ministers of madhya pradesh and rajasthan  among the spectators will be jyotiraditya scindia and sachin pilot the two young leaders who  too  had a dream. scindia had declined gandhi s offer to become nath s deputy while pilot accepted it grudgingly after much persuasion.also read    reasons why rahul gandhi picked ashok gehlot over sachin pilotmany explanations have been proffered by the party s spin doctors for the denial of the coveted jobs to the young leaders. but they don t cut much ice. for instance  to argue that gehlot is needed in rajasthan ahead of the lok sabha elections because he is an organisational man is far from the truth. during his two previous terms as the chief minister  he had rendered the organisation virtually defunct.what is getting more traction in the opposition party is a conspiracy theory that the claims by nath and gehlot just provided a convenient excuse to the high command. rahul gandhi couldn t have promoted his contemporaries as chief ministers when his political adversaries are questioning his own inexperience in matters of governance.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowbe that as it may  the latest instances may come as a blow to gandhi s plans to revive the organisation at the grassroots level. that s because those who have delivered or shown the potential are falling by the wayside. come to think of it  pilot spent five years rebuilding the party in rajasthan while gehlot was cooling his heels and doing backroom politics.scindia had been appointed campaign committee chief barely a few weeks ahead of the elections in     . he couldn t have done magic in such a short time. however  he continued to travel through the state and kept the heat on shivraj singh chouhan government. he was made campaign committee chairman in       again. scindia has been left high and dry again.also read  restless  young india has no connection to iits   iims  but rahul gandhi can t see itrahul gandhi appointed former youth congress chief ashok tanwar as haryana congress president nearly five years ago. the state party organisation has remained dormant under him. it s rather former chief minister bhupinder singh hooda and his son deepender who have kept the party flag flying with a series of agitation programmes and farmers  rallies in the state for the past four years. gandhi hasn t noticed them so far. deepender  a three term mp from rohtak  must be a confused leader today. the more his stature grows as a young  popular leader in haryana  the more irrelevant he is becoming in gandhi s scheme of thing.ex mp sandeep dikshit  another ex chief minister s son  must be equally confused. he was working closely with gandhi when his mother  sheila dikshit  was at the helm in the national capital. without a role in the party for long  sandeep has shifted his base to madhya pradesh to do social work even as ajay maken  his mother s old detractor  calls the shots in delhi  with gandhi backing him to the hilt.in uttar pradesh  raj babbar has been a disaster as the state unit chief but gandhi likes him and so he survives. meanwhile  young leaders such as former union minister jitin prasada  son of late congress stalwart jitendra prasada from up  must be wondering about their place in gandhi s new scheme of things.is it that rahul gandhi is suddenly indifferent to young leaders with political legacies or other privileges  one could understand it in the context of the ruling bjp that is presently led by self proclaimed  kaamdaars  such as narendra modi and amit shah. they are known to have a strong dislike for dynasts. therefore  a young and outspoken parliamentarian such as anurag thakur  a three term mp from himachal pradesh  finds himself on the sidelines.in       as then president of the bharatiya janata yuva morcha  bjym   thakur seemed to have arrived as a leader after he made national headlines for weeks due to his controversial march to hoist tricolour at lal chowk in srinagar. many expected him to become the darling of the rss and the modi shah duo. it didn t happen though. and it s not because of the mess in the bcci and his removal from the bcci president s post by the supreme court early last year.also read  dear troubled liberal  don t fear the

why ghanaians are removing gandhi statues
text size  a  a best way to commemorate gandhi in his    th year would be to critically examine him   not just garland and worship him.as prime minister narendra modi s government prepares to celebrate mahatma gandhi s    th birth anniversary in       students and professors of the prestigious university of ghana removed the freedom fighter s statue from the campus in the middle of the night this week.they considered gandhi racist and said that his statements about black people when he lived in south africa run counter to their hard fought battle for self respect and against colonialism and discrimination.gandhi often described black africans as  savage  and  raw   and wrote that  the white race in south africa should be the predominating race .many of these remarks were not exactly unknown   after all gandhi s books  journals and letters have been available in the archives for so long. he is one of the most well documented leaders of the   th century.so why is it all resurfacing now  a combination of new research  scholarship and the internet.also read  for much of his political career  narendra modi has been trained to dislike mahatma gandhiwe are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowfor too long  the global  peace  icon s controversial remarks about black africans were hidden by many scholars. a racist gandhi was just too inconvenient in the myth making project. and gandhi himself appears to have contributed to this project.gandhi was not alone. almost all south asian people believe they are  infinitely superior  to black africans and use the racist pejorative negro  habsi  kallu  kailla to describe them.   taslima nasreen   taslimanasreen  december         in a      article in the guardian  patrick french writes about how even ramachandra guha s book gandhi before india  seems to have excluded a great deal . it largely follows the authorised  conservative version of gandhi  when there is a doubt  he is given its benefit. for decades  the popular cliche in south africa went something like this   india gave us a mohandas  we gave them a mahatma .but people like historian runoko rashidi and author g.b. singh  gandhi behind the mask of divinity  have been highlighting gandhi s racism in recent years.in       two south african scholars   ashwin desai and goolam vahed  professors at the university of johannesburg and the university of kwazulu natal   removed some of the gandhi gloss through their book. they conducted a thorough scrutiny of gandhi s life in south africa   based on his own early writings and government archives   and discovered that the leader had indulged in some kind of sanitising of his past in his later autobiography. they published all these details in their book the south african gandhi  stretcher bearer of empire.also read  students in canada cannot fix racism by removing mahatma gandhi s statueindians had been taught that gandhi became a mahatma in india  but the roots of his  sainthood  lay in his years in south africa between      and     . the incident of being thrown out of a train in pietermaritzburg for being non white is taught in indian schools as an iconic and transformative moment when gandhi rose up against injustice. it is there in textbooks  museums and oral histories. however  what is absent from this version is that gandhi did not wish to be seated along with the black africans  as recent scholarship has revealed. that is why he protested the seating.in fact  the very basis of his struggle for the rights of indians living in south africa was the way he positioned indians above black people.during his fight against the system of separate whites and blacks  entrances to the durban post office  gandhi s main objection was that indians were  classed with the natives of south africa . he demanded a third entrance for indians. he wrote in an      petition that placing indians alongside blacks in public space would lead to the former being  degraded . he based this on his conviction that indians and the whites came from the common indo aryan stock.later in       gandhi wrote to the johannesburg municipal authorities that it was  very unfair  to make the indians live close to black people because  it is an undue tax on even the proverbial patience of my countrymen .in india  gandhi s conservative hindu views have been challenged by babasaheb ambedkar and several generations of dalit and anti caste scholars. even as he wrote against untouchability  he never really questioned hindu religion  whose dominant rituals supported and justified the caste system.also read  this leader forced mahatma gandhi to change his views on castebut all this while his racist views remained largely eclipsed from mainstream historiography. this was one of the reasons why gandhi s legacy successfully became a central part of india s soft power outreach globally. the power of his politics and ideas abroad is not unlike the sway that yoga enjoys among foreigners  especially in the west.thanks to the interconnected world of ideas and ideology that we inhabit  it is no longer possible to hide the unseemly aspects of revered historical figures. it will find a way to float up.many protestors in south africa believe that unless the gandhi statue is removed  the world will just not listen to the voices of africans and others.in december       a professor of african studies at the university of ghana  wrote a letter asking for a timeline for the removal of the gandhi statue from the campus. the university  in turn  wrote to the country s foreign affairs department  which said it will relocate it. the statue in ghana had been inaugurated by former president pranab mukherjee two years ago   a reason why ghana s government offered to relocate the statue instead of letting the campaigners bring it down.it is not just ghana  but a similar campaign is underway in malawi as well where communities are trying to stop the erection of a gandhi statue in blantyre.from racist to saint is a rather incredible trajectory. did gandhi evolve over time  or was he  like all mortals  a bundle of contradictions  or was he just a very smart strategist who didn t always believe that means justify the end whatever be the truth  the best way to commemorate gandhi in his    th year will be to critically examine him   not just garland and worship him.this article

narendra modi government may have won this rafale round  but congress can still fight
text size  a  a questions will be raised on how supreme court judgment got crucial facts  like cag report on rafale being examined by pac  wrong.does the narendra modi government stand vindicated in the rafale deal  yes and no.for  although the supreme court s dismissal of the pils seeking probe into the rafale deal comes as a shock for most congress supporters  the judgment does leave a lot of elbow room for the congress to exploit.government has wonit is only to the extent that the supreme court has ruled that it finds  no reason for any intervention by this court on the sensitive issue of purchase of    defence aircrafts by the indian government .this doesn t prevent parliament from setting up a joint parliamentary committee  jpc  to probe the rafale deal. the supreme court can t and hasn t directed parliament to take that route.but following the supreme court order  the modi government will certainly go to town  claiming the congress   lies  have been exposed.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowalso read  sc on rafale pils  setback for rahul s campaign or lesson not to politicise defence deals the sc order also grants the government a shield against the charge of  chowkidar chor hai   which has been levelled by congress president rahul gandhi repeatedly. the court s order in very clear terms said that it did not  find any substantial material on record to show that this is a case of commercial favouritism to any party by the indian government .but  modi government sceptics will say that the focus should be on the court s choice of words here   material on record . what if new facts emerge later congress hasn t lost eitherthe congress   its attack could be blunted after today s order   hasn t exactly lost the big war. the supreme court order clearly says that today s judgment is  primarily from the standpoint of the exercise of the jurisdiction under article    of the constitution of india which has been invoked in the present group of cases .in saying this  the court is acknowledging that the decision is based on the limited scope of judicial scrutiny in terms of article    of the constitution.while our courts  including the supreme court  are known to have crossed the lakshman rekha of judicial propriety in the past  in the current case it has held itself back  thereby acknowledging that it cannot convert itself into an investigation agency while hearing a plea under article   .also read  supreme court merely sniffing secret envelopes to see if there s a scam in rafale dealnothing prevents rahul gandhi and his supporters from continuing to question the deal. also  if tomorrow  the opposition or any concerned citizen wants to file a criminal case against anyone  either within or outside the government  on the rafale issue  that option is still open.also read  everything you wanted to know about rafale and did not know who to askall eyes on cag nowthe supreme court certainly seems to have got this one wrong.it claims the  report of the cag  on rafale  has been examined by the public accounts committee  and that  only a redacted portion of the report was placed before the parliament  and is in public domain.  the comptroller and auditor general  cag  has not submitted its report.how could the supreme court allow this factual inaccuracy to creep into such a sensitive judgment while it is certainly true that cag is performing a financial audit of the rafale deal  the report has not been tabled in parliament   redacted or otherwise   so far.in fact  sources in the cag have told theprint that the report has  still not been finalised  and may be sent to parliament before the budget session next year if it is finalised by then.incidentally  the congress delegation has met the cag twice in the last three months to seek an early report in the case.even former bjp minister yashwant sinha who was a petitioner in the case had asked cag to give the report at the earliest.what happens to investigation in france while french civil society group sherpa association filed a complaint at its national financial prosecutor s office last month  alleging  potential acts of corruption   there is still no clarity on which way that investigation is headed.this fact seems to have been completely missed by the supreme court while dealing with the case. if the french investigation throws up something  then it may be difficult for even the supreme court to close its doors to the demand for an independent probe in the rafale deal.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis   only you can fix it you

the defining difference between narendra modi   rahul gandhi that nobody has spoken about
text size  a  a after the bjp loss in the hindi heartland  barkha dutt asks an intriguing question  has rahul gandhi s metrosexual appeal beaten narendra modi s machismo to help congress in rajasthan  madhya pradesh and chhattisgarh what do you think is the main difference between prime minister narendra modi and congress president rahul gandhi men set apart by a    year age difference.is it ideology  politics  personality  you will hear a lot of analysis on these assembly elections and the bjp defeat we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowbut here is my take.this is a generational clash between hardline machismo and metrosexual softness.between the strongman with the    inch chest and a mischievous love your enemy hug.and  of course  the wink that followed.    think about itfor so long now the modi government has been driven by an aggressive masculinity.perhaps this positioning was crafted in response to manmohan singh   who was seen to be too silent. and too paralysed in his last years.but since then the machismo of the bjp has never been dialled down.they are the tough guys who will protect the nation crackdown on corruption and  yes  even take    per cent of india s cash out of circulation.because risk taking is supposed to be a sign of strength    but sometimes tough men can become bullies.intolerant of independent opinion.cheerleaders of brute force.practitioners of communal taunts.protectors of murderous mobs.and generals of troll armies.    it is in this environment of what raghuram rajan called chest thumping that rahul gandhi  perhaps  saw a moment to make his own.now politics is not a hallmark card.and  of course  mr gandhi s choices will also be calculated and strategic but if you hear his press conference right after his party took wins in the hindi heartland there was humility  and no flaunting of male ego.instead  there was a promise to learn from precisely those mistakes of the bjp.and in  perhaps  the most exemplary subversion of machismo rahul gandhi has chosen to own the jokes about him  instead of growling back at them.yes  even the pappu ones.sometimes in life love and politics overdone masculinity can become unattractive.ask us women.and there can also be strength in softness.see you next week.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis   only you can fix it you are reading this because you value good  intelligent and objective journalism. we thank you for your time and your trust. you also know that the news media is facing an unprecedented crisis. it is likely that you are also hearing of the brutal layoffs and pay cuts hitting the industry. there are many reasons why the media s economics is broken. but a big one is that good people are not yet paying enough for good journalism. we have a newsroom filled with talented young reporters. we also have the country s most robust editing and fact checking team  finest news photographers and video professionals. we are building india s most ambitious and energetic news platform. and we aren t even three yet. at theprint  we invest in quality journalists. we pay them fairly and on time even in this difficult period. as you may have noticed  we do not flinch from spending whatever it takes to make sure our reporters reach where the story is. our stellar coronavirus coverage is a good example. you can check some of it here. this comes with a sizable cost. for us to continue bringing quality journalism  we need readers like you to pay for it. because the advertising market is broken too. if you think we deserve your support  do join us in this endeavour to strengthen fair  free  courageous  and questioning journalism  please click on the link below. your support will define our journalism  and theprint s future. it will take just a few seconds of your time. support our journalismshow full article




bjp needs the congress  it should abandon  congress mukt bharat  slogan
text size  a  a bjp s best chances of winning are in those states where congress is powerful.with the three large states in the hindi heartland   madhya pradesh  rajasthan and chhattisgarh   going out of their hold  the bjp s slogan of  congress mukt bharat  suffers a setback.very few slogans have had a game changing effect in elections in the last    odd years of our democratic experiment. indira gandhi s  garibi hatao  was one such slogan. in       bjp s ace campaigner narendra modi enthralled his audience with another such powerful slogan   congress mukt bharat  or an india free of congress. neither political analysts nor the congress party took it seriously.but an overwhelming majority of the voters seemed to have taken a fancy for the slogan and punished the congress with    seats in lok sabha  lowest ever for the more than a century old party.also read  can congress build on state poll results or will modi be harder to beat nationally in      the congress  slide continued further and at one stage  the congress is believed to have represented less than six per cent of the population and ruled over just two states  karnataka and mizoram. the bjp  on the other hand  had a free run in maharashtra  gujarat  madhya pradesh  rajasthan  chhattisgarh  himachal pradesh  uttaranchal and assam. incidentally  all these were states ruled by the congress. the only states where the bjp did poorly or had to share seats with allies were punjab  odisha  bihar  and west bengal.here is the catch. there is no bjp government in many of the states where the congress is weak or the party is totally marginalised. states like west bengal  tamil nadu  telangana  andhra pradesh are the ones where the congress has been a no show for quite some time now. strangely  these are the very states where the bjp s prospects too have been marginal or next to nil. in the recently held      assembly elections  the bjp has won one seat each in mizoram and telangana.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowwhat could be the political lesson for the bjp in this  electoral arithmetic clearly proves that the bjp s best chances of winning are in those states where the congress is powerful and or is in direct contest with the bjp. as for the congress  the best bet for winning  as in the case of recently concluded elections  is in bjp ruled states. it has drawn little or no support in telangana in its fight against the regional party trs and has lost to another regional party mnf in mizoram.also read  post kairana  bjp needs to fear regional parties  not congressthe bjp too stands a better chance to defeat the congress than wrest seats from a regional party such as trs  tdp  aiadmk or bjd. strange as it may appear  both the congress and the bjp stand to gain only when they are pitted against one another. both parties seem to draw a blank when they are faced with regional parties.the need for partners for the nda and upa will probably be more pronounced after the      elections. the bjp will require a larger nda coalition than it has now with just three parties.the unwelcome fallout of  congress mukt bharat  for the bjp would be to have a direct contest with regional parties sporting regional identity and endowed with strong local leadership. a quick reality check would reveal that the chances of bjp trouncing the local leadership and competing with regional  read parochial  identity are bleak. it is more or less the same with the congress too.also read  pakoras  polarisation and popularity of modi  key takeaways from state election resultswhat is the way out then  should the bjp still continue with its slogan  and strategy  of  congress mukt bharat   bjp strategists may like to deliberate on this and reframe their slogan to something better than eliminating the

takeaways from the state elections that rahul gandhi must not ignore
text size  a  a rahul gandhi must enable local leadership and end the influence of delhi based political strategists.more than prime minister narendra modi and the bharatiya janata party  bjp   the results of the five state assembly elections tuesday will have a strong impact on the future of congress and its president rahul gandhi. if the assembly elections are a  semi final  before the big final polls next year  then it is also a test for gandhi and his team.nobody  least of all voters and party workers  likes a leader who is on a losing spree. and nobody would be more aware of this than gandhi.if the congress doesn t win at least two out of the four states   mizoram won t help gandhi s cause much   questions will be asked if his leadership is taking the congress on the correct path  one that could eventually lead to narendra modi losing power next year.in case the congress wins just one state but gives a tough fight to the bjp in the other states  gandhi would do well not to listen to excuses like the party did put up a good fight. nobody remembers who came second in a race  especially where there are only two contestants.congress strategist ahmed patel s victory last year in the rajya sabha election from gujarat set the tone for the party s near revival. but the party president must remember that gujarat is still with the bjp even if the voters seemed to have decided to give congress a chance.also read  state elections are not the semi finals to      battle for congress or bjpwe are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowlocal leadershipvoters like a leader and a party with a killer instinct to win at all cost.if the congress doesn t win despite the strongest ever anti incumbency faced by the bjp chief ministers of rajasthan  madhya pradesh and chhattisgarh  no amount of excuses will turn the truth sweet.bereft of finances  the congress also needs to be in power in some more states if it wants to match the deep pockets of the bjp in the next general elections.but if the congress wins two out of four  then it will also give gandhi and his team the chance to put more faith in the state leaders. it will also provide him the capital to junk  substantially if not fully  the moribund system of delhi based drawing room leaders who run the party while ground level state leaders are forced to wait on them with folded hands. many of these central leaders can t even strategise but have positioned themselves as political strategists.gandhi must know that punjab was won not because of any leader from delhi but because of captain amarinder singh  a charismatic leader with ample grassroots support. singh was given a free hand to take on the shiromani akali dal bjp government  and to select candidates.the high command should intervene only if the local leadership becomes an irritant or is so unpopular that it starts to hurt the party.the possible victory in rajasthan  madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh will prove that the way forward for rahul gandhi is to place more trust in leaders like sachin pilot  who really toiled hard on the ground  creating the tempo for the party to build a fine campaign to dethrone vasundhara raje. it s commendable that rahul gandhi also ensured that there was minimal friction between pilot and the old guard led by ashok gehlot   at least it did not spill out and embarrass the party.ditto for madhya pradesh  where the duo of kamal nath and jyotiraditya scindia worked in tandem  with former chief minister digvijaya singh content to play a strong supporting role.also read  state elections are bad news for bjp and not good news for congress eitherway forwardrahul gandhi is no indira gandhi  he simply doesn t have the charisma or connect with the masses that were the hallmark of his grandmother. what he certainly does have is perseverance and  of late  a dogged determination to win.but to win  he needs to put more faith in his state leaders. bhupinder singh hooda in haryana  ashok chavan in maharashtra  revanth reddy in telangana  adhir ranjan chowdhury in west bengal  bhupesh baghel in chhattisgarh  siddaramaiah and d.k. shivakumar in karnataka.also  he needs to send out his delhi based leaders to the states and make them accountable for wins and losses. these leaders must not be measured on how well they give  gyaan  on tv screens  but on how they win the elections in the states.unless this is done  gandhi and his congress will always finish second  before eventually fulfilling modi s dream of a  congress mukt bharat .also read  if not modi or rahul  whom would you

if congress wins even two states  rahul gandhi is set to become a bigger brahmin
text size  a  a competitive hindutva could become central to the public discourse if the congress wins two of the three bjp ruled states tuesday.the outcome of the assembly elections tuesday     december  could turn out to be a watershed in contemporary indian politics. not because it will draw the battle lines for      lok sabha elections. not also because it would be the first time in five years that the congress could dislodge a bjp government in any state. and definitely not because it would make us any more enlightened about the popularity ratings of narendra modi and rahul gandhi.tuesday s electoral verdict could be a watershed because it would determine the character and politics of india s oldest party  the congress. if there is one individual who has the biggest stake in this round of assembly elections  it s congress president rahul gandhi.with the bjp virtually succeeding in attaining its objective of a  congress mukt bharat   gandhi sought to re invent himself and his party in these elections. from being listed as a  non hindu  in gujarat s somnath temple register a year back  he went on to become a  janeudhari shiv bhakt  and emerged as a dattatreya brahmin a fortnight back. his party  the congress  has also got transformed from being portrayed as a  muslim party  that indulged in  appeasement politics  into one that promises commercial production of  gau mutra  cow urine   and development of  ram path  or the mythical route lord ram had taken during his exile.if the congress does well on tuesday   that is  if it wins even two of the three bjp ruled states   rahul gandhi is set to become a bigger brahmin and his party more brahminical in its politics  however much leaders such as shashi tharoor argue that it  remains a party for all  the safest refuge for the minorities  and fundamentally committed to secularism. also read  dear troubled liberal  don t fear the congress partycompetitive hindutvaif the congress comes up trumps on tuesday  it would set the tone for      lok sabha elections  with competitive hindutva becoming central to the public discourse and the people left with the option of choosing between a

the run up to the elections.booth level workers were given training about how they would bring voters  block attempts to rig the polls and  watch over evms . suspicious of the ruling party s attempt

charge of the state chandan yadav with yadavs. the idea was to wean away influential obcs from modi.at the macro level  gandhi managed to ensure a semblance of unity on the ground and got faction leaders to work in tandem  even in madhya pradesh. he was perceived to have humiliated former mp chief minister digvijaya singh by keeping him out of the congress working committee  but it dawned on the political adversaries later that it was a well thought out strategy to  neutralise  the bjp s usual focus on singh s  misrule  for    years to scare away voters.also read  decoding rahul gandhi s

if not modi or rahul  whom would you vote for in      
text size  a  a the      general election  seen through a conversation with strangers in a train.in a train from udaipur to indore friday  i had for company a retired bank manager from mandsaur  his wife  who wasn t too interested in politics but listened keenly to our conversation  and a young man in his early twenties who lived in udaipur but travelled frequently to ujjain and indore for work. a credit risk analyst for a financial company  he travels to meet loan applicants in rural and suburban areas  assessing their creditworthiness.the usual political notes were exchanged  they were both bharatiya janata party  bjp  voters and modi supporters but expected the party to lose in madhya pradesh as well as rajasthan. they were both relieved at the thought. in rajasthan  vasundhara had to be removed  and in madhya pradesh  the local bjp mlas and workers.but what about modi   modi is ok   said the young man.  modi theek hai   echoed the bank manager. why do you like modi  i asked  making a mental note of the change from  great  in      to  ok  in     .the credit risk analyst said   well if you compare him to rahul  me   for a moment  don t compare   but we have to compare   he said   it s like a multiple choice question  mcq . there are only four options. we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe now let s say this is not an mcq. this is an essay. evaluate modi s performance. what has he achieved  i asked.he paused for a moment  and then said   well  he s been really bad with the economy. notebandi was his worst decision. we have still not recovered from the slowdown caused by it. i had asked for achievement  i got failure. so why do you say modi is ok   i probed further.also read  what do modi haters say when confronted with the tina factor  magic with words  see  he has increased india s stature before the world   the analyst replied   by going to every country  he made the world respect indians. i have relatives abroad and they tell me how they are called brownies and all  but modi has made them feel proud. wherever he goes  he meets nris  i feel happy he s reaching out to nris. it shows he cares about indians everywhere.  yes  but has modi improved relations with other countries   i began to count his foreign policy failures and flip flops. yes  yes   the young man agreed  to my surprise.  he s been terrible at foreign policy too.  so then why is he ok   see  he is a very smart politician who always defeats the enemy   he said   as in chess  your purpose is to defeat the enemy   but that may not be a great thing in politics. democracy needs an opposition   i said. yes  but i like it that modi is a smart politician. people tend to appreciate smart people. i said i thought people liked modi mainly because he was a good orator. they both agreed.  bol bol ke ghumata rehta hai  he keeps people enthralled with his words    said the bank manager. his reticent wife added   uske munh se jadoo nikalta hai  magic comes out of his mouth .  he speaks like a mature person  not like rahul gandhi   said the credit risk analyst. so none of you can count many of modi s achievements  but will still vote for modi   i asked. wohi baat hai na   the credit risk analyst returned to his mcqs   aur hai kaun  this rahul gandhi   that s what i m saying. who s the alternative  not rahul gandhi . after nehru  who  why is it so important to know who the next pm will be   i asked. during indira gandhi s time  there used to be a question  after indira  who  i corrected him. the question was asked of nehru. and by the way  india did just fine after nehru  democracy survived  and we didn t slip into some anarchy or dictatorship  as some feared.he didn t buy the argument. so i asked   who do you think would make a better pm than modi   yeh toh sochna padega  i will have to think about it . i could tell you in a day  the young man was open to changing his political preferences  he explained  having wasted some time as an aap volunteer in udaipur. if only there were a better option than modi what do you think of raghuram rajan  i asked.  he is brilliant   the young man said.  first class   said the bank manager. the current rbi governor   the young man said  unable to even recall urjit patel s name   is not even fit to be raghuram rajan s servant.  so let me get this right   i said  wanting clarity.  if raghuram rajan were to be the congress party s pm candidate  you would both be happy to press the hand symbol on the evm  instead of the lotus   absolutely   the young man replied.  bilkul   added the retired bank manager.but that was not going to happen  they said. what about priyanka gandhi   i asked. she ll be good   the young man said. dadi pe gayi hai  bohot tez hai  she is very sharp    the retired bank manager replied.  modi tik nahi payega priyanka ke samnay  modi wouldn t be able to hold his own against her .  dadi pe gayi hai  she has taken after her grandmother  indira    said the bank manager s wife.for all the complicated analysis of the pundits in delhi  this is the earthy wisdom of the ordinary voter. they re ready to say goodbye to modi  but not for rahul gandhi.the opposition can try and make it an un presdential election  but it is unlikely that they can prevent the voter from asking  after modi  who also read  indian intellectuals hate rahul gandhi as much as they hate narendra

ambedkar was wrong  gandhi wrote against untouchability in gujarati journals too
text size  a  a ambedkar said it at a time when not many authentic compilations of gandhi s writings were available.babasaheb ambedkar s scathing views on mahatma gandhi and his approach towards caste are well known. but he levelled a serious and sweeping charge on gandhi in an interview he gave to bbc in     .replying to a question on whether gandhi fundamentally changed india  ambedkar said   he  gandhi  was all the time double dealing . he summarily charged gandhi for  deceiving the people . in the english paper  he posed himself as an opponent of the caste system and of untouchability  but if you read his gujarati magazine  you see  you will see him  as  most orthodox man. he has been supporting the caste system  the varnashram dharma  and all the orthodox dogmas    he then added   the western world only reads the english paper where mr gandhi in order to keep himself  you see  in the esteem of the western people who believe in democracy was advocating democratic ideals  you see. ambedkar suggested someone should  write mr gandhi s biography by making a comparative study of the statements made by mr gandhi in his harijan and the statements made by mr gandhi in his gujarati paper .also reads  this leader forced mahatma gandhi to change his views on castewe are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is

were available.but now we have     volumes of collected works of mahatma gandhi  cwmg  along with its hindi and gujarati translations. it is hosted by gandhi heritage portal  gandhiheritageportal.org . the same portal also has all the issues of all the journals published by gandhi and his associates  including the ones referred to by ambedkar.gandhi s articles in gujarati journals navjivan             and harijan bandhu       onwards  are also meticulously translated in english and have been included in the volumes of cwmg. so  ambedkar s claim in the interview that  all the biographies that have been written of him  are based upon his harijan  and young india but not upon the gujarati writing of mr gandhi  was right in     . but it no longer holds true  with the publication of cwmg.gandhi asked ambedkar to send a message for the first issue of harijan  the english weekly. ambedkar didn t send one but wrote a note  which was published with gandhi s own comments   dr ambedkar   caste   harijan     february      p.  . contrary to ambedkar s claim about gandhi in the interview  the latter had always remained firm in his opinion that   caste system  has its limitations and its defects  but there is nothing sinful about it  as there is about untouchability . he continued   and  if it is a by product of the caste system  it is only in the same sense that an ugly growth is of a body  or weeds of a crop. it is as wrong to destroy caste because of the out caste  as it would be to destroy a body because of an ugly growth  .    dr. ambedkar   caste   harijan     february      p.  one may have many disagreements with gandhi s ideas  but he can t be accused of presenting a different face to  the western world .let s check gandhi s gujarati writing. the editorial of the first issue of harijan bandhu  the gujarati weekly started in march       is titled  gujaratione  meaning  to gujaratis .  harijan bandhu     march       p.  the article has been translated verbatim and included in corresponding volume of cwmg  like all his gujarati articles. he clarified at the outset that  i am not at all eager to publish harijan bandhu merely for the sake of publishing it. i do not have that much time. do not get upset by the fact that it will mostly contain translations from english  i shall have to write at least something addressed to gujaratis only. i shall have to bear some burden therefore. to me  harijan bandhu is a special atonement. i have been pouring soul into this movement.   cwmg vol.     pg.      also read  understanding the new dalit identity  radical

glorious hour  i am ready to die. the mantra of my life consists in making preparations of it. to live while untouchability lives is like cup of a poison to me. in fact  he wrote   i should spend all my energy to kill the ravana of untouchability .  harijan bandhu     march      p.   it was translated in english in cwmg as  employ whatever strength to subjugate the demon of untouchability .  cwmg vol.    p.   reflecting on ambedkar s threat of conversion  gandhi wrote an editorial titled  limitation of reformers  in harijan     march       p.   . categorically criticising the conduct of  vast number of hindus who call themselves sanatanists   gandhi wrote   the wonder is that any more harijans than already have  have not left hinduism  sic .  this article was translated and published as an editorial in harijan bandhu titled  sudharak ni maryada  without slightest dilution or change of tone.  harijan bandhu     march       p.   the harijan papers were banned in august      due to the quit india movement. after the ban was lifted and the papers were revived in       gandhi once again told his gujarati readers to excuse him if they find in the gujarati paper  more translations of my english articles than original gujarati articles .  cwmg vol     p.    he published a translation of his english editorial   its implications   harijan     february       p.   in gujarati with the title  ashprushyatanivaran no arth   harijan bandhu     february  p.   without any dilution. he said   a brahmin may be a depraved man in spite of his learning. it would be preposterous to call him one  it is character  not occupation  that determines the man. the bhangi is or should be on a par with the brahmin in all social relations  i would be happy to see the day when a bhangi  working as such  is in the presidential chair  of congress .   harijan     february       p.   the gujarati translation used the word  durachari  for  depraved  and  julam  for  preposterous   making the gujarati expression more direct and more pointed.also read  br ambedkar  the congress critic who saw gandhi and patel as opposed to dalitsironically  the accusation made by ambedkar has had a long

     elections will see greater mudslinging between modi rahul than state polls
text size  a  a it is doubtful if voters will ever get to vote for a party that gives them a balance sheet of their performance.in a fight to finish election  polling for rajasthan assembly is underway. the peaceful polling by voters is in stark contrast to the high decibel trading of barbs  charges and counter charges and below the belt attacks by all parties. the      assembly elections have become a test case for the ensuing      lok sabha elections  not just for the numbers  but also the way campaigning will be done.elections are increasingly turning out to be more of a strategic action plan to trounce the opponent than convincing the voter about how best one would serve the electorate. the      lok sabha elections are likely to witness greater mudslinging and could be extremely spiteful if the rising acrimonious pitch in the assembly elections is any indication.the campaigning threw up a number of national level issues such as corruption during the upa regime  the national herald case  the rafale deal  demonetisation  gst  dynastic politics  parentage details of narendra modi and rahul gandhi  and to top it all  agustawestland  kickback . the extradition of christian michel  and the subsequent grilling by the cbi under full media glare  provided ample optics to prime minister narendra modi to take pot shots at the congress  first family . it was a bad day for the congress  which put up a brave face in the midst of screaming breaking news headlines like  noose tightens on family  and  it is clear family got kickbacks .also read  state elections are not the semi finals to      battle for congress or bjpthe truth about the agustawestland scandal would be known only after the entire case goes through the court proceedings spanning over a few months  if not years. none of the earlier high volume kickback charges has been proved so far nor has anyone been convicted for corruption.during the run up to the      lok sabha elections  the bjp made a convincing campaign out of spectrum allocation   g  g  case and adarsh housing scam. but strangely  those involved in both cases were let off the hook. the bofors case is buried deep in the dusty labyrinths of power corridors. but the fact that these allegations stuck to then governments resulting in their unceremonious exits cannot be denied.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowcorruption charges of late have become easy tools in the hands of politicians to discredit opponents. more importantly  it allows the accuser to occupy a high moral ground. the modi government has successfully entered a number of high value international arms deals and other commercial contracts without attracting even one single corruption or kickback charge. this perception has helped modi and bjp president amit shah level kickback charges on the congress. with rahul gandhi being the only star campaigner on the congress side  the entire responsibility of answering the acts of commission and omission of the upa ii lies on him  ironically  without having been part of it.the bjp has a very strong cadre base and the party has put in place a closely knit network of booth level workers who ensure that the committed party sympathisers come out and vote. while this section of voters can be counted on  the modi amit shah campaign adds grist to the strategy by targeting the fence sitters who expect corruption free governance.it is beyond one s comprehension as to why the congress has not been able to effectively bring the issue of governance and performance of the three bjp governments to the centre stage of electioneering. initially  it was expected that the congress would effectively put the bjp on the mat by raising the issue of lack of performance by the three bjp led governments. but unfortunately  rahul gandhi s gotra and his parents  religion became the dominant narratives.also read  bjp is on a better wicket in parliamentary elections than in state electionsto add to the congress party s trouble  a video of madhya pradesh congress leader kamal nath addressing select muslim leaders for votes also went viral during the last phase of electioneering. the bjp effectively used the video to counter their  islam khatrey mein hai  islam in danger   narrative to its advantage in addressing the hindu vote bank. the congress probably walked into the trap laid by bjp s poll strategists.the modi shah duo has established one thing clearly that they are the best vote vending machines in the last    years  probably outshining indira gandhi s  garibi hatao  slogan. since       after winning     seats in lok sabha and stunting the congress to a mere     the duo has won more than    states and countless state assembly elections. the winning spree was made easier also due to the woefully bad electoral strategy of the congress and near absence of the seasonal third force  which invariably mushrooms after election announcements. the only electoral combination that rattled the bjp was the sp bsp tie up in up to defeat the bjp candidate who contested in the prestigious parliamentary seat vacated by yogi adityanath after becoming chief minister of up.also read  state elections are bad news for bjp and not good news for congress eitherthe political re grouping and war room strategies of parties will be known only after the assembly poll results are out on    december. but what looks certain is the acrimony that is likely to dominate the poll narrative and the campaign in     . it is doubtful if the voters will ever get to vote for a party that gives them a balance sheet of their

state elections are not the semi finals to      battle for congress or bjp
text size  a  a the      elections will be starkly different from state assembly polls and a modi versus rahul battle.the curtains will come down on the frenzied assembly polls across five states as campaigning for the last lap ends wednesday  but despite a very acrid and aggressive contest  these state elections are not the semi final to the grand      lok sabha elections   either for the bjp or the congress.bjp and the modi factorfor the ruling bjp  this has been a tough contest  to say the least. in three of the states   rajasthan  madhya pradesh and chhattisgarh   the party is fighting double anti incumbency  defending its record in the states as well as a five year term at the centre.a key reason the results of these polls are unlikely to reflect on the      lok sabha election is the absence of narendra modi as a primary factor. the bjp s state leaders   shivraj singh chouhan  raman singh and vasundhara raje   are the dominant faces in their respective states and the pivots of these elections. modi has had to play second fiddle to them.for the voters in these states  the vote is not for modi but for their regional leader. unlike in other states   like assam  uttar pradesh and tripura   where the bjp s sprint to power revolved entirely around the modi card given the absence of regional faces  these states have their own established leaders whom the voter considers as the bjp s face.given that this is not a vote for modi  the outcome of these polls can  at best  be a hazy indicator of the bjp s fortunes in     .also read  what modi can teach maharani  mamaji and chawal wale baba this election seasonwe are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowthe lok sabha polls will be aggressively and unapologetically fought by the bjp in prime minister narendra modi s name  thus  sharply differentiating its campaign  narrative and strategy from the current state polls.while this is not the      semi finals  this is as final an examination as it can get for bjp s three incumbent chief ministers. madhya pradesh cm shivraj singh chouhan and chhattisgarh cm raman singh have three full terms in their kitty  and despite being reasonably young for politics      and    respectively   have emerged as strong regional leaders and near giants in bjp s state landscape.however  while both of them were at the same level as prime minister narendra modi even five years ago  modi has raced ahead and how  establishing his hegemony over the party. for both singh and chouhan  this election is crucial to reassert their importance in the bjp  to prove that unlike modi  they may be limited to one state but continue to have the power to deliver these states for the bjp. essentially  this is as much an intra party battle for power for these two as an inter party one.for the third incumbent cm   vasundhara raje   this is a fight for relevance. she is the weakest among the three cms and her massive unpopularity and questionable governance record in the state have meant this election is a trial by fire for her. raje also shares a tense relationship with the bjp s central leadership  particularly party president amit shah. a humiliating defeat  therefore  could well mean the end of an active political career.survival of the congressthe congress is fighting for survival. at this point  it is in power in only three states   punjab  karnataka and mizoram  besides the union territory of puducherry. mizoram went to polls on    november and results are awaited. the party has been in shambles at a pan india level  and its best bet for recuperation is a state wise revival.its performance in these state elections  however  is not a determinant for its show in the      election for two primary reasons. one  the congress is basing these elections primarily on the high level of anti incumbency against the bjp regimes in three states.this  however  may not be the case in lok sabha  where the anti incumbency sentiment against the modi government could be more muted  and with the pm s continued popularity  the big advantage the congress has in these polls will not be on its side.two  the party may not have declared cm faces  but at least in rajasthan and madhya pradesh  its state leaders are adding weight to the party s campaign. this election is not centred on party president rahul gandhi  and much like modi  is not particularly a vote for or against him. the      elections  however  will be starkly different. the bjp will do all it can to make it seem like a modi versus rahul battle  knowing fully well that in this face off  the former has more than just an edge.also read  state elections are bad news for bjp and not good news for congress eitherto be sure  while these polls may not be a curtain raiser to       they will have a bearing on the party cadre and workers  morale and confidence level. they will also add or deduct from the ability to attract allies  especially for the congress  which is attempting to be the fulcrum of an anti bjp coalition.for both the bjp and congress  the current assembly polls are a final test in themselves. the   th of december is unlikely to reveal the tarot card that would tell them their fortunes for     .subscribe

before any election  trust rahul gandhi s frenemies to lend modi s bjp a helping hand
text size  a  a a handful of congress leaders seem to have perfected the art of gifting the sympathy factor to narendra modi.that prime minister narendra modi likes to play the victim in almost every election rally is well known. even the bjp spokespersons and party s strategists are now busy finding reasons to portray india s  strongman  prime minister as one who is always on the receiving end of the opposition jibes. but  what is not so well known is that there are a handful of congress leaders who are helping modi in this narrative   knowingly or unwittingly.most of these congress leaders may themselves not remember the last time they won an election. but they appear to have perfected the art of gifting the sympathy factor to modi through their controversial  sometime downright abusive  statements. most of these statements are delivered in the middle of an election campaign. they are in the congress party but they can best be called rahul gandhi s frenemies.it helps that most tv channels are more than eager to amplify these controversial statements  helping the bjp and narendra modi s cause.also read  real reason why rahul gandhi doesn t want to declare cm candidates for state electionsconsider this  last year  the ruling bjp seemed to be on the back foot in the run up to the gujarat assembly election while the congress  strengthened by the massive support of the patidars and dalits  was confident of reclaiming the state after a long time  till mani shankar aiyar struck.bang in the middle of a high voltage campaign  the senior congress leader and gandhi family favourite opened his mouth  called modi  neech kism ka aadmi   and gave modi and the bjp the opening that they needed to breach the congress campaign. while the congress suspended the former minister  the damage was done and no explanation could help the party s cause.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowaiyar is back in the party fold  and has somehow restrained himself during the ongoing election campaign for the five states. but  the other loudmouths in the congress party refuse to learn.ghulam nabi azad  senior congress leader and leader of opposition in the rajya sabha  claimed that hindu candidates of his party had stopped calling him to campaign for them. the statement made last month was happily lapped up the bjp  which turned it into an allegedly muslim loving  and  therefore by extension  anti hindu  congress versus hindu loving bjp battle.similarly  when former madhya pradesh chief minister digvijaya singh was heard in a viral clip telling his party workers that he isn t going for campaigning since his speeches  make the congress lose votes   guess who used this statement extensively to remind voters in madhya pradesh about the misrule of the congress  the bjp.digvijaya singh  after all  was the last congressman to rule the state and it didn t hurt the bjp one bit to remind the voters that he was also close to rahul gandhi.also read  in madhya pradesh  narendra modi ko gussa kyon aata haia video  possibly shot on a mobile phone camera  resurfaced just a week ahead of the    november elections in madhya pradesh. it purportedly showed a congress leader and the man who could  if the congress manages to win the state  be the next chief minister of madhya pradesh telling a group of muslims that unless muslims came out in large numbers to vote  the congress might find it difficult to win. the evening news was  as expected  taken up by discussions over the video and  anti hindu congress .if kamal nath  who ran a rare wonderful campaign that the congress party hasn t seen since       falls short of the required numbers in madhya pradesh  this video would be seen as one of the major reasons for that.but if there was an award that the bjp could give for the statement that helped its cause the most  my guess is  it would be bestowed upon congress mp raj babbar.the filmstar turned politician made not one but several controversial statements in the ongoing election campaign for the five state assemblies   each statement helping the bjp more than the previous one.to begin with  he compared the falling rupee to the age of modi s mother. to be fair to babbar  what he had said was that earlier modi  when he was the chief minister of gujarat  used to pass snide remarks  comparing the falling rupee to  then  prime minister manmohan singh s age. but  now the rupee was nearing his  modi s  mother s age.also read  the fall of the rupee shows india has been  swimming naked unfortunately for babbar and the congress party  the bjp went to town only with one part of the statement  with even the pm  at his dramatic best  asking the voters to punish the congress  whose leaders were dragging his hapless mother into politics.days before this gaffe  babbar came up with another gem   he compared naxals to revolutionaries or  krantikari   leaving the congress red faced and the bjp laughing all the way to the tv studios.it isn t as if the bjp leaders don t make inflammatory statements. but then the congress doesn t seem to have most of the media on its side to help amplify those.but  despite all these gifts by the congress leaders  the bjp may still lose some of the states. the voter is often smarter than the politician and experts.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis   only you can fix it you are

dear troubled liberal  don t fear the congress party
text size  a  a while bjp doesn t even pretend to be secular  congress remains the safest refuge for minorities in india.as i address audiences around the country  one of the questions i find myself increasingly being asked is   isn t the congress now practicing a form of  soft hindutva   haven t you become  bjp lite   the short answer is no. i have long argued that any attempt to emulate  pepsi lite  by  bjp lite  will end up like  coke zero    that is  congress zero. congress is not bjp in any shape or form  and we should not appear to be attempting to be a lighter version of something we are not.but the question is asked repeatedly  and it requires a fuller answer. the questioners tend to point to congress president rahul gandhi s temple visits  digvijaya singh taking credit for banning beef in his state  kamal nath promising gaushalas in every district of madhya pradesh  the congress party s support for sabarimala devotees in kerala against the supreme court verdict allowing women of reproductive age to worship at the shrine  and for that matter even my own book why i am a hindu  to suggest that the congress party is emulating the bjp in appealing to hindu sentiment rather than to its own secular traditions.also read  why sabarimala issue leaves instinctive liberals like me torn  shashi tharoorthe respected columnist g. sampath  writing  ironically enough  in the hindu  even questioned  whether the congress can emerge as a meaningful alternative to the bharatiya janata party  bjp  and its hindu majoritarian politics . repeating the  soft hindutva  charge  mr sampath averred  that even an outright victory for a congress led alliance in       however improbable it may seem at present  may not really signify a defeat of communal forces . he concluded that  liberals and other good hearted people hoping that mr. gandhi and the congress would rescue them from hindutva may be in for a rude awakening .we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowsuch criticisms do not take the congress  own assurances at face value   that it remains a party for all  the safest refuge for the minorities  the weak and the marginalised  and fundamentally committed to secularism. but the truth is that congress is the only major party to say all of this and mean it. the bjp does not even bother to pretend that it has the interests of any of these sections at heart.our critics see the congress party s distinction between hinduism and hindutva as specious. they reject its leaders  arguments that the hinduism respected by congress leaders is inclusive and non judgemental  whereas hindutva is a political doctrine based on exclusion. they are quick to conclude that what the congress offers is merely a watered down version of the bjp s political messaging.nothing could be farther from the truth. rahul gandhi has made it explicitly clear that  for all his willingness to avow his personal hinduism  he does not support any form of hindutva  neither soft nor hard. the congress understands that whereas hinduism is a religion  hindutva is a political doctrine that departs fundamentally from the principal tenets of the hindu faith. while hinduism is inclusive of all ways of worship  hindutva is indifferent to devotion and cares only about identity. hinduism is open to reform and progress  which is why it has flourished for       years  hindutva is reactionary and regressive  with its roots in the  racial pride  ethos that spawned fascism in the     s  which is why it is unlikely to outlast its current peak this century.also read  bjp will hand ayodhya victim card to every hindu voter ahead of      electionsthere are more fundamental differences. congress leaders profess a hinduism that accommodates a vast amount of diversity and respects the individual and his her relationship with the divine  the bjp s hindutva prefers communal identity politics and seeks to semitise the faith into something it is not   a uniform monolithic religion. congress leaders  hinduism rests on swami vivekananda s ideas of the acceptance of difference  embracing with respect people of other religions  the bjp s hindutva seeks to erase differences by assaulting  intimidating and subjugating those with other views.why then should the liberal indian feel any despair in hindu congressmen avowing such a version of their personal faith  in this congressman s understanding  hinduism is not a totalising belief system  it offers a way of coping with the complexity of the world. it acknowledges that the truth is plural  that there is no one correct answer to the big questions of creation  or to the meaning of life. the greatest truth  to the hindu  is that which accepts the existence of other truths.most faiths prioritise one identity  one narrative and one holy book. to the congressman  hinduism recognises that everyone has multiple identities  accepts diverse narratives and respects several sacred books. indeed  the folk hinduism of multiple beliefs cannot be forced into the abrahamic framework of one book  one deity and one way of doing things  which is what the bjp would prefer. the more the hindu grapples with the great questions  the more he she understands how much is beyond our understanding. but hindutva prefers to deal in certitudes.for me  as a congressman and an avowed liberal  i find it easy to claim allegiance to hinduism a religion that is personal and individualistic  privileges the individual and does not subordinate one to a collectivity  a religion that grants and respects complete freedom to the believer to find his or her own answers to the true meaning of life  a religion that offers a wide range of choice in religious practice  even in regard to the nature and form of the formless god  a religion that places great emphasis on one s mind  and values one s capacity for reflection  intellectual inquiry  and self study  a religion that distances itself from dogma and holy writ  that is minimally prescriptive and yet offers an abundance of options  spiritual and philosophical texts and social and cultural practices to choose from. these are not the qualities admired by the advocates of hindutva. in a world where resistance to authority is growing  hinduism imposes no authorities  in a world of networked individuals  hinduism proposes no institutional hierarchies  in a world of open source information sharing  hinduism accepts all paths as equally valid. in every case  hindutva asserts the opposite.also read  the   cs that mark congress  decline from secularism to soft hindutvaso  i would say to the troubled liberal  have no fear. the congress  even in visiting temples and professing hinduism  is not about to abandon you. our faith has nothing to do with the hindutva that you rightly abhor. it remains true to the tolerant  liberal heart of the hinduism that has made india the safest place for non hindus. and we are not going to allow the bjp to change that.shashi tharoor is an mp for thiruvananthapuram and former mos for external affairs and hrd. he served the un as an administrator and peacekeeper for three decades. he studied history at st. stephen s college  delhi

bjp is more interested in sachar report on muslims than congress now
text size  a  a once a congress project  sachar report is now a tool for bjp to beat it with.in a recent article published in the official journal of the bjp  kamal sandesh  national spokesperson  gopal krishna agarwal described the sachar committee report        as a symbol of muslim vote bank politics. he argues the upa during      to      tried to create divisions in the indian society to reap electoral gains.  it   had constituted sachar committee for muslims and was trying to make changes  which were extra unconstitutional. a fabricated narrative in the name of  saffron terror  was developed by congress government in order to consolidate muslim votes.this response is not at all unanticipated. the bharatiya janata party  bjp  has always been critical of what it calls  muslim appeasement . and the constitution of a commission by former prime minister manmohan singh specifically for muslims goes well with the party s rhetoric of  vote bank politics .yet  this observation is not entirely correct.also read  from rajiv gandhi to modi  nobody defines  muslim appeasement  but all use it for voteswe are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nownarendra modi government s ministry of minority affairs still recognises the sachar report as an important  source book  for its schemes. the ministry this year submitted an  action taken report  to both houses of parliament with regard to implementation of the sachar report.the    point programme introduced by manmohan singh for the welfare of minorities is still treated as a fundamental principle to deal with the exclusion of minorities in general and muslims in particular. the ministry s website also features a report  commissioned by the goi in       on the impact of these    points on minority communities.does it mean that modi led bjp is also involved in muslim vote bank politics  these apparent contradictions actually point towards two basic questions. first  is it possible to read the sachar report as a political project  if yes  what is nature of this politics  which primarily revolves around the issues of social justice  backwardness and underrepresentation of muslims a political story of sachar reportthe dominant view is that the idea to have an official commission to examine the socio economic backwardness of muslims originated in       when manmohan singh was sworn in for the first term. that is factually incorrect.muslim backwardness as a political category began to take shape in the late     s. the mandal commission evolved a method for identifying obcs among non hindu communities. it paved the way for the inclusion of a few muslim backward castes in the obc list.the rise of muslim pasmanda  marginalised  politics was the obvious outcome of this development. this new kind of muslim politics questioned the caste based social stratification among muslims and demanded that muslim dalits be included in the scheduled caste category.the national commission to review the working of the constitution  ncrwc         which was set up by the atal bihari vajpayee government  submitted the first official report that recognised muslim backwardness as a policy concern. it argued that  backward classes belonging to religious minorities   should be taken up with special care .the commission made a strong recommendation for adequate political representation of muslims in legislative bodies. in its recommendation no.      the ncrwc says at present  the political representation of minority communities in legislatures  especially muslims  has fallen well below their proportion of population  this can lead to a sense of alienation. it is recommended  that   political parties to build up leadership potential in the minority communities  the role of the state for strengthening the pluralism of indian polity has to be emphasised.there is virtually no difference between the suggestions given by the ncrwc and the recommendations of the sachar commission report. in fact  the basic premise of the sachar report stems from the ncrwc  which strongly advocated for inclusion of all marginalised groups in the public policy discourse.interestingly  political parties treated these official reports as political objects. the bjp appreciated the ncrwc report wholeheartedly  but found it difficult to accept sachar report. similarly  the congress remained sceptical about ncrwc  but highlighted the sachar report as its achievement.and then  the story of sachar report gets a new twist in recent years. the congress has completely disassociated itself from it. the party s manifestos for the recent assembly elections are virtually silent about the recommendations of the sachar report. the leaders of the party are now very careful about the use of the word muslim. for instance  the madhya pradesh election manifesto  which is called vachan patr  employs the term aplsakhyak  minorities  for addressing muslims and clubs it with pichra varg  backward classes  in order to make a few general promises about their development in the state.the sachar report  it turns out  can now certainly be described as a context driven political project of the congress  which has lost its symbolic electoral capability. the congress does not want to rely on the narrative of muslim victimhood because it might upset its own version of hindutva.also read  did the congress benefit from rahul gandhi s temple tourism  here s what the data showsnature of politicstwo crucial political aspects may be traced behind these shifting positions of political parties. first  the constitution of the sachar commission helped the upa government and the congress elite to recreate and sustain  muslim  as a legitimate political category. the report was used by the congress to mobilise muslims as beneficiaries  though they were nothing but an object of an academic analysis . for the hindutva forces and the bjp  the sachar report was an evidence of muslim appeasement  which was to be employed to secure the hindutva vote bank in     .second  the sachar report has an official status. it is an authoritative official account of muslim marginalisation  which is deeply rooted in public policy discourse on social justice. it is a compulsion for the government to follow it through at the ministry level.also read   kitney mussalman hain   why this sachar committee question to army was an abominationthe bjp uses this administrative obligation differently. unlike the congress  it does not celebrate the ministry of minority affairs. instead  the bjp wants to retain the sachar report   primarily because it can always be used as an evidence to justify hindu victimhood politics.after all  the sachar report gives a sarkari status to all muslims.hilal ahmed is a scholar of political islam and associate professor at centre for the study of developing societies. theprint is publishing three series on minorities in india by hilal ahmed. the  sarkari muslim   minority report  and

decoding rahul gandhi s eagerness to be accepted as a brahmin
text size  a  a brahmin means entitlement  and rahul gandhi wants to embrace it.congress president rahul gandhi is putting every effort possible to show his brahmin identity. his party colleagues like to boast about his janeu or sacred thread. by now  everyone knows that he is a kaul brahmin and his gotra is dattatreya. the fourth generation of jawaharlal nehru  the eternal panditji of modern indian politics  is flaunting its brahmin origin with vengeance.like all of us  rahul also has multiple identities   religion  language  caste gotra kula  skin colour  gender  sexual orientation  political party affiliation  club or association membership  alumni of some institution  and profession. we decide what should be our primary and secondary identity at different points in time.nowadays  rahul gandhi is choosing to project his secular  a word that has a different connotation in the western and indian contexts  and brahmin identity. by doing that  he is perhaps trying to derive political benefit in the election season.is it beneficial to be a brahmin  do they have some privileges  which other castes don t have  let s unpack the knapsack of brahmin privileges.also read  why rahul gandhi will fall off the tightrope between hindu and hindutvawe are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowthis is not an easy task. there isn t much literature on this topic. libraries are full of books on sociological studies of deprivation and exploitation of dalits  shudras and women. but it s almost impossible to find books on brahmin or savarna privilege  or how they perpetuate caste. this is a big problem with indian sociology. professor vivek kumar has highlighted that  domination of the twice born castes works at four levels   as members practicing sociology in universities  institutions and colleges  in the sphere of production of knowledge while writing chapters of books  producing knowledge with the help of scriptural sources  or producing data from the field and while teaching sociology in the classrooms .as explained by noted feminist writer and scholar peggy mcintosh  we can assume that there is a hypothetical imaginary line of social justice where things feel fair. below this line  people can feel being bullied  they can face slurs  they can be stereotyped  cornered or discriminated and be considered unworthy. we know so much about the happenings at this level.what we do not know is what happens above this hypothetical line of social justice  their advantages  their privileges  how they are pushed up  how they are believed  considered to be capable of doing intelligent things and producing academic work  seen as virtuous and classy. we have departments of dalit studies  minority studies  tribal studies but nobody is doing brahmin or savarna studies. that s why we do not have any literature on brahmin privilege  read more on lack of elite studies in this brilliant speech by author martin nicolaus .also read   rahul gandhi practicing actual hindutva  and not soft hindutva in western social science  we have ample literature on white privilege. the most popular of these was written by peggy mcintosh in        of caucasian descent and equipped with an honesty to write about the privileges accorded to her race. as no brahmin in india has the guts and the honesty to write on the privileges they have  i will try to map this phenomenon based more on common sense and a perspective from below. hope this helps decode rahul gandhi s eagerness to be accepted as a brahmin.what is brahmin privilege  . if i am a brahmin  i will be revered in the society and a  ji  will be added to my name. i will be known as a pundit  although i can be dumb or even illiterate. . if i am a brahmin  there will not be any difficulty in getting public accommodation. i need not fear that people of my caste cannot get in or will be mistreated in the places they choose. . almost all public places will be open for me. . i will find restaurants serving food according to my cultural choices. asking food of my choice will not be considered a bad thing. rather  that will enhance my stature. . if my neighbour or co traveller knows my caste identity  he she will not hate me or look down upon me. . i can upload my profile on brahmin matrimonial sites and not face prejudice. . there is every possibility that the interview board i will be facing in a university department will have representatives of my caste. . if i am a brahmin  i can be sure that the books and texts prescribed in the school and college syllabus will reflect my cultural leaning  and many of them will be written by people belonging to my caste. . whenever i am told about our national culture or about hindu civilisation  i am sure that i am hearing about something that is our caste heritage.  . whenever i will be travelling to any hindu religious place  i will find no difficulty in getting accommodation.  . if am travelling abroad  i will find a diaspora dominated by my caste members. many of them are employed because of the diversity policies of foreign companies.  . despite getting jobs due to the affirmative action policies in the west  i will keep opposing reservations in india.  . despite getting jobs under diversity principle  i will not consider myself less meritorious.  . i will oppose affirmative policies of india and consider myself caste blind or caste neutral. opposing reservation will not make me casteist.  . when i enter a music store and ask for traditional indian music  there is a fair possibility that the shopkeeper will hand me over something that has been produced by my caste brethren.  . my caste gets almost     per cent reservation for the position of a priest  but i dislike the constitutional scheme of reservations.  . even if i don t have domain knowledge to speak on a topic  i will be considered eligible to speak. my  c  grade work will be cited in research papers by virtue of my surname.  . being oblivious and ignorant about the customs  traditions and present situation of the majority population  which is lower caste  does not make me a bad scholar. i will still talk about the whole nation.  . my love for the nation and patriotism are a given  and even if someone of my caste sells defence secrets to pakistan or china that will have no bearing on my caste.  . my caste is the mainstream.  . i get jobs in the private sector easily because my name is referred to by people of my caste in higher positions. but that does not make me casteist.  . if i speak for the backward classes or scs  i will be considered humanist and democrat.  . but if someone from the lower caste does the same  he she will be branded casteist.  . when i watch television to follow news or debates  my caste people are over represented as analysts  anchors and editors.  . my caste people write most of the opinion pieces in the  national press .the university libraries are full of books written by scholars of my caste.  . if i do something foolish or boorish  or even heinous  nobody will attribute it to my caste.  . i will consider myself a great humanist for eating or studying or working together with a dalit or attending marriage of someone from the lower caste. this is sufficient to make me caste neutral.  . if my roommate or hostel mate is someone of a lower caste  i can produce this fact to prove that i am not casteist.  . if i am a brahmin and if a case is being heard in the higher judiciary  there is a fair possibility that someone of my caste will be at the bench to hear my case.  . if i am a brahmin  i will find it easy to publish my thesis in an academic journal where people of my caste are members of the editorial board.rahul gandhi knows this and wants to embrace the brahmin brand.also read  here

beyond congress or bjp  mizoram elections hold a lesson for post insurgency politics
text size  a  a mizoram assembly elections prove that normalisation of electoral process roots out insurgency.on   march        four fighter jets of the indian air force were deployed to bomb aizawl

  reasons why alliance with mehbooba mufti s pdp could hit congress  nc in jammu   kashmir
text size  a  a if congress now joins hands with pdp  it will once again cede ground to the bjp in jammu and kashmir.politics is the art of the impossible. that is why reports suggesting a move is afoot in jammu and kashmir to install a pdp congress government  with the national conference  nc  offering support  aren t surprising to anyone.they are getting as much traction as earlier reports that said the bjp  after its split with the pdp in june  was on track to break its former ally to form a government in jammu and kashmir  with either a hindu from jammu or people s conference s sajad lone as the chief minister.the fact that j k has a very stringent anti defection law  one that makes it almost impossible for a party to be split  was conveniently ignored in all the hoopla.also read  more killings  greater alienation  how the situation in kashmir is slipping out of handinterestingly  reports about the new efforts at government formation emerged within minutes of senior pdp leader muzaffar hussain baig  lok sabha member from baramulla constituency  indicating yesterday his intention to leave the pdp   a party he helped found   and join the  third front .cut to present. there are several reasons why the latest move may either prove to be a non starter or end up hurting the nc and the congress in the state. here are three we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowwill nc end up helping the pdp revive itself the million dollar question is that even for the sake of preserving  kashmiriyat   why should the farooq abdullah led nc help prop up a mehbooba mufti led government   or under any other leader   in the state. the pdp is floundering  it has lost much of its base in kashmir. the mehbooba mufti led pdp bjp government was disliked so much that its ministers and pdp mlas could not even move around freely in their own constituencies. why  then  would the nc help in its revival true  both the pdp and the nc are worried over the bjp s plan to help sajad lone get more traction in the valley   didn t the centre s man in the state  governor satya pal malik  anoint nc turned pc leader junaid azim mattu as the mayor of srinagar a few days ago  but  surely  even they know kashmiris deeply distrust anybody seen as an out and out pro centre voice  one reason why mehbooba mufti became so unpopular in the valley.but since both the pdp and the nc are mainly after the bigger piece of the same pie called the kashmiri voter  why would the nc help the pdp in that endeavour  unless the pdp decides that it is okay with an nc leader   omar abdullah   as the chief minister. or will the nc agree to another nc leader   altaf bukhari   as cm also read  jammu and kashmir is india s most corrupt state  says anti graft body chairmanwhy would the congress help strengthen the bjp like the pdp in the kashmir region  although not of the same level  the bjp has lost some ground in hindu dominated jammu regions. almost all its gains in the last assembly elections   it won    seats   came at the expense of the congress. if now  the congress joins a pdp led government  it risks alienating the hindu voters and could end up with even fewer seats than the current tally of   .also  the focus of all the parties is on the next year s lok sabha elections   of the six lok sabha seats in the state  the bjp won three in     . the congress will give a big leg up to the bjp on the two jammu seats if it now joins hands with the pdp.do remember one reason extended by the bjp for quitting the mehbooba government was her government s soft handling of militancy in the valley.if it now joins hands with the pdp  the congress will once again cede ground to the bjp. and let s not forget that kashmir is an issue not limited to voters in the state alone. the bjp will use it against the congress across the country.having said that  if recent actions of the congress  particularly some of its leaders  have shown anything  it is that the party s timing is mostly off. don t be surprised if leaders like ghulam nabi azad actually manage to persuade the party leadership to be part of a new government in the state.is congress ready to forget humiliation by mehbooba s party in      in july also  after the bjp had dumped mehbooba mufti  there was talk of the congress supporting her. i had then written that one reason why the congress won t align with the pdp is that it hasn t forgotten the humiliation of       when mufti mohd sayeed  who had entered into a three year for each party at the helm arrangement with the congress  pulled out of the ghulam nabi azad government.the congress has still not forgotten that humiliation and is also aware of the fact that it was mehbooba mufti who had pushed her father into withdrawing support.although it is often said that there are no permanent friends or foes in politics  the big question is  is the congress ready to move on  especially  since the pdp brings nothing to the table.also read  in nearly   years of modi govt at centre  has kashmir s situation worsened or improved ps  even if the three parties with a combined strength of    in the    member assembly agree to come together to form the government  a lot will depend on whether the narendra modi led government allows that to happen. having invested so much political capital in the state  to expect modi to simply roll over and allow the new government to be formed may be a bit na ve.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis   only you can fix it you are reading this because you value good  intelligent and objective

the   cs that mark congress  decline from secularism to soft hindutva
text size  a  a in congress  slide to soft hindutva  the fraud of secular politics has been exposed.a gaushala in every panchayat  a cow sanctuary in the state  commercial production of gau mutra  building narmada parikrama and ram van gaman path this shows the congress  slide from secularism to  soft hindutva . it did not happen overnight. it s time we traced the decline of secular politics in four distinct stages since independence.the items in the congress manifesto for madhya pradesh assembly election have been seen  rightly so  as signs of the congress  surrender to politics of hindutva. mind you  these promises are not as ridiculous and regressive as these are made out to be.animal welfare demands more and better run gaushalas. promotion of cultural tourism justifies construction of narmada parikrama. but that is surely not what motivates the congress. it is a desperate attempt by the congress to play on the hindutva wicket set by and for the bjp. the chairman of the congress  manifesto committee was disarmingly candid in admitting that the party was keen to shed the  muslim party  tag.also read   rahul gandhi practicing actual hindutva  and not soft hindutva this is not the first time the congress has shown proclivity towards  soft hindutva . rahul gandhi has followed this strategy in gujarat and karnataka too. and the congress is not the only  secular  party taking this path. akhilesh yadav s samajwadi party has promised building of a grand vishnu temple.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowsecularists have responded to this  soft hindutva  turn in two ways. the more  principled  secularists have decried it as a regrettable slide into majoritarian politics. they believe that secular politics has given up on the more difficult but feasible path of taking on communalism frontally. the more  pragmatic  secularists argue that the congress has no other option. they see this as a justified but short term tactic to take on hindutva on its own terms. so  those who think it is regrettable argue that it is avoidable. those who think it is not avoidable find it justified. this dilemma and debate is likely to persist right through the lok sabha polls. and perhaps  after that as well.both the sides are partly true. pandering to majoritarian sentiments is without doubt a worrisome trend. it may look like a tactical move today  but yesterday s tactic is today s norm. at the same time  it is equally true that parties like the congress have no option today. in today s context  they cannot afford to take a  hard  secularist position  if they hope to win elections. so  the congress style  soft hindutva  is both regrettable and necessary. secular politics has no one except itself to blame. what passes for secular politics has made no room for itself to take principled secular positions. the mid point of public opinion is simply not prepared for hard secular policies and politics. not to put too fine a point  secular politics is paying for its sins.also read  the good muslim bad muslim binary is as old as nehruthe slide from politics of conviction to politics of capitulation did not happen overnight. i suppose there are four stages that brought secular politics  step by step  to the current impasse. you may also see these four as tendencies that have existed within secular politics right from the beginning.secular politics began as politics of conviction. in the aftermath of partition  it was courageous  almost heroic  to uphold the idea that india is not a hindu pakistan. mahatma gandhi s supreme sacrifice and jawaharlal nehru s popularity created an unusual condition for passage of legislation like the hindu code bill. to be sure  there was already a disconnect between secular politics and the sensibility of an ordinary  believing hindu. but an undercurrent of hindu unease  especially among the partition  refugees  who suffered its violence  did not matter much at that moment. muslims were too shocked and unsettled. a secular india was good reason for them to commit to this young nation.soon  conviction gave in to convenience. as challenges arose to the congress hegemony  a large and growing muslim community proved to be a very useful ally for the dominant party. the congress leaders realised that securing muslim votes was rather easy. you just needed to make the right noises  extend some symbolic concessions and keep the muslim clergy happy. politics of muslims as vote bank and policies aimed at appeasement of the muslim clergy were born then. ordinary muslims got little out of this  but an ordinary hindu began to notice  preferential treatment  of the muslims.the third phase was the worst  as convenience turned into an electoral and political compulsion for secular politics. the congress began to lose elections as large groups like the obcs moved towards the opposition. now  assured muslim vote was critical to the congress  survival. the surest way of doing so was to keep muslims insecure. and lest they forget their need for security  riots happened at regular intervals. other  secular  parties copied the model invented by the congress. unlike other castes and communities  you don t need to offer education  jobs  bijli  sadak  paani to secure muslim votes. just keep them insecure and keep offering them security. muslims were perfect political hostage to  secular  politics. anything that pandered to muslim  sentiment  as defined by its leadership was kosher  as secular politics was seen to be pro minority. any party opposed to bjp could call itself secular. hindus were distracted by caste politics that was presented as social justice. the results were disastrous  muslims kept receding into backwardness while hindus resented the appeasement of minorities.also read  dear rahul  soft hinduism can be a winner  but not with soft nationalismthis set the stage for what we see today  capitulation of secular politics. the ayodhya movement busted the duplicity in secular politics. elections provided enough incentives for a politics of hatred and lies supported by the sangh parivar. long disengagement with and disrespect for public opinion had left secular politics with little resources to counter these lies. the centre of public opinion shifted towards hindutva. secular politics faced a hobson s choice  it could take a  hard  line and face electoral marginalisation. or  it could go for  soft hindutva  and betray its cause. some strands of secular politics delayed the encounter with public by playing caste divisions. but the inevitable happened in     . no wonder the congress style secular politics has capitulated.we don t yet know whether  soft hindutva  will pay in the short term. but we do know that this not the way forward in the long run. secularism needs to be rescued and reinvented  for secularism is a sacred principle of the indian republic. we either have secular india or we have no india. but rescuing secular principles must begin by exposing the fraudulence of what goes by the name of secular politics.yogendra yadav is national president of swaraj india.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis   only you can

real reason why rahul gandhi doesn t want to declare cm candidates for state elections
text size  a  a the cm face is the critical x factor in winning elections. why doesn t rahul gandhi get it rajasthan is a foregone conclusion. a congress victory in the state will not necessarily mean the bjp will do poorly in the lok sabha elections in rajasthan. the rajasthani voter s verdict now and in may      is likely to be very different.rajasthan s elections are always somewhat boring because voters have internalised the idea that they must change their state government every five years. like some law of nature. even a taxi driver in jaipur will tell you how they like to turn the roti around every now and then lest it burns.the rajasthan results will be better analysed for the scale of the congress victory. what s the big deal winning rajasthan with just a few seats above the majority mark when it s your turn to rule the state anyway also read  in madhya pradesh  narendra modi ko gussa kyon aata haiwhat s likely to prevent a clean sweep in the state is the congress party s inability to decide who the chief minister will be. the tussle between ashok gehlot and sachin pilot is such that the election seems to be between them. if the congress had declared a cm candidate well in advance and done the campaign around him  we would have been looking at a clean sweep.again  the reason why the bjp s defeat in rajasthan is certain is because vasundhara raja scindia has become unpopular  as have her mlas. but for all the disenchantment with the local faces  people actually like the bjp and narendra modi.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowshivraj versus rahulif the bjp is all set to lose rajasthan because its local face has become unpopular  it could retain madhya pradesh and chhattisgarh because the local faces in these two states are still popular. raman singh has been the chhattisgarh cm since      and shivraj singh chouhan has been the madhya pradesh cm since     .the anti incumbency sentiment has been piling up in both the states but voters largely don t target the cms. they abuse the local bjp  their mlas  the system  the bureaucracy   but the cms themselves are not the target of anger. it s the same with other long term cms  be it nitish kumar in bihar or naveen patnaik in odisha or mamata banerjee in west bengal.a popular cm face is the critical x factor in winning elections but rahul gandhi just doesn t seem to get it. he made kamal nath the madhya pradesh congress chief just six months before the election. what is six months to go around mounting a campaign in a large state not that kamal nath has been declared the cm candidate.  i am not a chief ministerial candidate. i will do whatever congress president rahul gandhi decides   he told abp news monday. voters will think even if he becomes cm will he be answerable to us  or to rahul gandhi  this is how the congress undermines its own local leaders.also read    reasons why lutyens  media could be off the mark on state electionsthe bjp also likes to fight elections in the name of narendra modi rather than the local cm face  but at least when the sitting cm is popular  they don t undermine him. it s not a modi but a raman singh campaign in chhattisgarh. it s not a modi but a shivraj singh chouhan campaign in madhya pradesh. in karnataka  the congress cut to size its own sitting cm siddaramaiah earlier this year. he wasn t declared cm candidate and rahul gandhi s campaign overshadowed siddaramaiah  taking away whatever campaign space other leaders had left.happy to loseit s a bogus argument that declaring a cm face leads to factionalism in the party. did the congress not declare a cm face in punjab despite factionalism  the dissidents have to be given incentives and disincentives for a united campaign. not declaring a cm candidate actually increases factionalism because it leads to endless undermining of one leader by another in the party campaign.a cm face could have made the difference between victory and defeat for the congress in the gujarat assembly election. a personality campaign could have made madhya pradesh and chhattisgarh fall into the congress  lap. so why doesn t rahul gandhi get it he doesn t  because if a state is won in the name of the local leader  how will rahul gandhi get any credit the only state where the congress party has formed government  on its own  since      is punjab. ever heard anyone give credit to rahul or sonia

real reason why rahul gandhi doesn t want to declare cm candidates for state elections
text size  a  a the cm face is the critical x factor in winning elections. why doesn t rahul gandhi get it rajasthan is a foregone conclusion. a congress victory in the state will not necessarily mean the bjp will do poorly in the lok sabha elections in rajasthan. the rajasthani voter s verdict now and in may      is likely to be very different.rajasthan s elections are always somewhat boring because voters have internalised the idea that they must change their state government every five years. like some law of nature. even a taxi driver in jaipur will tell you how they like to turn the roti around every now and then lest it burns.the rajasthan results will be better analysed for the scale of the congress victory. what s the big deal winning rajasthan with just a few seats above the majority mark when it s your turn to rule the state anyway also read  in madhya pradesh  narendra modi ko gussa kyon aata haiwhat s likely to prevent a clean sweep in the state is the congress party s inability to decide who the chief minister will be. the tussle between ashok gehlot and sachin pilot is such that the election seems to be between them. if the congress had declared a cm candidate well in advance and done the campaign around him  we would have been looking at a clean sweep.again  the reason why the bjp s defeat in rajasthan is certain is because vasundhara raja scindia has become unpopular  as have her mlas. but for all the disenchantment with the local faces  people actually like the bjp and narendra modi.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowshivraj versus rahulif the bjp is all set to lose rajasthan because its local face has become unpopular  it could retain madhya pradesh and chhattisgarh because the local faces in these two states are still popular. raman singh has been the chhattisgarh cm since      and shivraj singh chouhan has been the madhya pradesh cm since     .the anti incumbency sentiment has been piling up in both the states but voters largely don t target the cms. they abuse the local bjp  their mlas  the system  the bureaucracy   but the cms themselves are not the target of anger. it s the same with other long term cms  be it nitish kumar in bihar or naveen patnaik in odisha or mamata banerjee in west bengal.a popular cm face is the critical x factor in winning elections but rahul gandhi just doesn t seem to get it. he made kamal nath the madhya pradesh congress chief just six months before the election. what is six months to go around mounting a campaign in a large state not that kamal nath has been declared the cm candidate.  i am not a chief ministerial candidate. i will do whatever congress president rahul gandhi decides   he told abp news monday. voters will think even if he becomes cm will he be answerable to us  or to rahul gandhi  this is how the congress undermines its own local leaders.also read    reasons why lutyens  media could be off the mark on state electionsthe bjp also likes to fight elections in the name of narendra modi rather than the local cm face  but at least when the sitting cm is popular  they don t undermine him. it s not a modi but a raman singh campaign in chhattisgarh. it s not a modi but a shivraj singh chouhan campaign in madhya pradesh. in karnataka  the congress cut to size its own sitting cm siddaramaiah earlier this year. he wasn t declared cm candidate and rahul gandhi s campaign overshadowed siddaramaiah  taking away whatever campaign space other leaders had left.happy to loseit s a bogus argument that declaring a cm face leads to factionalism in the party. did the congress not declare a cm face in punjab despite factionalism  the dissidents have to be given incentives and disincentives for a united campaign. not declaring a cm candidate actually increases factionalism because it leads to endless undermining of one leader by another in the party campaign.a cm face could have made the difference between victory and defeat for the congress in the gujarat assembly election. a personality campaign could have made madhya pradesh and chhattisgarh fall into the congress  lap. so why doesn t rahul gandhi get it he doesn t  because if a state is won in the name of the local leader  how will rahul gandhi get any credit the only state where the congress party has formed government  on its own  since      is punjab. ever heard anyone give credit to rahul or sonia gandhi for that  credit has gone only to captain amarinder singh and  if any was still left  to the captain s private campaign consultant  prashant kishor.in fact  it s no secret that rahul and captain haven t been on the best of terms. rahul gandhi was reluctant to declare captain as the official cm candidate of the party until the fag end of the campaign.also read  state elections are bad

why the congress party should stop apologising about dynasty
text size  a  a voters actually like dynasty  and the congress must wear it as a badge of honour.if there s any bjp voter thinking of switching over to the congress  prime minister narendra modi has a reminder  all power in the congress is concentrated in the hands of one family.on prime minister narendra modi s charge that a non gandhi cannot be president of the congress party  p. chidambaram pointed out names of non gandhi party presidents before and after       and also examples of people like manmohan singh and p.v. narasimha rao whom the congress made prime minister although they did not come from the nehru gandhi family.his defence didn t work because pm modi only furthered his attack  reminding everyone how sitaram kesri was humiliated by the congress  his office physically taken over by sonia gandhi loyalists in a coup.also read  congress calls out pm modi for latest gaffe sitaram kesri was obc  not dalitthe congress party cannot claim to be democratic in its internal leadership  because it is not. it is not an argument they can win. in doing so  they come across as apologising for being led by a political dynasty. it is strange that they should apologise for their only usp  the nehru gandhi dynasty.it s a charge the modi led bjp is making every single day to discredit the congress. by defending itself  the congress only falls into the trap.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowkhandaani netathe truth is that indian voters don t care about dynasty. if anything  it helps voters trust a politician  knowing s he comes from a political family they have trusted in the past. why  just look at the number of dynasts who ve been given tickets by the bjp for the madhya pradesh elections.every fifth winner in the      lok sabha elections was a dynast. across the country  in every state and every party  political dynasties are flourishing. fifteen of    ministers in the modi s council of ministers are political heirs  as per a september      report. from yogi adityanath to devendra fadnavis  from vasundhara raje to pema khandu  from maneka gandhi to varun gandhi  the bjp is full of leaders who could get into politics thanks to their surnames. it is strange that amit shah should run the bjp like a cabal of families and then accuse the congress of being a family enterprise.also read  rahul gandhi has shown no sign that he wants to change the dynasty culture in congresspolitical dynasts must be bringing something to the table that indian voters place so much trust in them. you could argue that indian politics isn t that open to outsiders  but it is rare to meet a voter who says s he is not voting for a politician because s he is a dynast. instead  one only sees dynasty re imposing trust. you ll typically hear people say  purane neta they hamare  bohot kiya hamare liye  ab unka ladka aaya hai  us hi ko vote denge  he was an old leader of ours  he did a lot for us  now his son is contesting. we ll vote for him .the bjp s trapthe case of vasundhara raje scindia is rather funny. she comes from the scindia family of gwalior in madhya pradesh  which is better known for being part of the congress. her son is a bjp mp too  carrying forward her own political dynasty. and she recently complained about how the congress party is controlled by four members of the gandhi family the bjp s hypocrisy is proof that its attacks on the nehru gandhi family are only meant to put the congress on the back foot in the narrative wars. every time the congress takes the bait  it does itself a disservice  making it look weak and the bjp stronger. often the bjp doesn t even have to try. rahul gandhi goes abroad and gives interviews to nri academics in which he almost sounds like saying  i m sorry for being a dynast .instead of apologising for being from the nehru gandhi family  rahul gandhi should boast about it. the nehru gandhi dynasty is the only usp of the congress party. had it not been for the nehru gandhi family  there would have been no congress party left. the reason why congressmen begged sonia gandhi to take over the reins was because it was collapsing like a pack of cards under narasimha rao and sitaram kesri.also read  the political dynasty nobody is talking about  sardar patel swear it on your sleeveinstead of counting the non gandhis who have led the congress  p.chidamabaram should say he s proud to be led by the nehru gandhis. two members of this family laid down their lives for india. nehru spent almost nine years in jail to fight for india s freedom. he was made the congress president for the first time on the recommendation of mahatma gandhi  whom mr modi has been trying to appropriate.like all influential leaders  the nehru gandhis are a mixed bag of some great achievements and some poor choices. yet  you ll find none other than the hindutvawadis abusing them. people old enough to remember nehru  indira or rajiv only remember them fondly. instead of apologising for the surname  the congress should launch a campaign taking ownership of the dynasty. perhaps  the most amazing dynast till date has been sonia gandhi  who managed to displace a towering bjp leader like atal bihari vajpayee. under her leadership  the congress ruled india for    years recently  and voters did not buy the bjp s  italian  rhetoric about her.it is only by resurrecting nehru  indira and rajiv as icons of modern india that rahul gandhi can revel in some inherited glory. short of achievements in his own cv  rahul gandhi can sell himself to voters as the heir of a family identified with india s freedom  democracy and progress over the decades  warts and all.an earlier version of this article erroneously stated that    of    ministers in modi s cabinet are political heirs. it has been updated to  council of ministers .subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis   only you can fix it you are reading this because you value good  intelligent and objective journalism. we thank

by demonising rss in madhya pradesh  congress is only helping bjp
text size  a  a it is not clear why congress should antagonise rss in madhya pradesh when its president is busy brandishing his hindutva identity.the congress party in madhya pradesh has stoked an unnecessary controversy by pledging to check the growth of the rss instead of providing an alternate economic agenda for the state. pitted against a three time winning bjp  it seems they would rather waste their political capital on trivial issues.re construction of the road traversed by hindu god ram in madhya pradesh during his    year exile  commercial production of cow urine  providing a gaushala  cow shed  in every panchayat and a budgetary allocation for a separate fund for them  establishing temporary camps to treat injured cattle and perform their last rites if required. do not dismiss this as a bjp manifesto  this is actually the congress  manifesto. the only give away is the line on the rss. the congress promises to rein in the rss by prohibiting government employees from attending rss shakhas.also read  congress promises restrictions on rss shakhas in mp  cynical poll ploy or hard secularism the indian government in      categorised the rss and the jamaat e islami as political organisations and issued an order saying that participation in the activities of these organisations by government servants would attract provisions of sub rule     of rule   of the central civil services  conduct  rules      .   mha om no.       s     ests. b   dated   .  .      . an office circular was reissued in      and again in       probably due to political exigencies.   mha om

worst kind of isolation within her own party and outside of it. the communist party was the only one supporting her. this necessitated acceding to their demands too.some state governments followed up and issued circulars to this effect covering their respective states. in       madhya pradesh chief minister shivraj singh chouhan annulled the order and lifted the ban on civil servants joining the rss and said   as far as sub rule   of rule   of the madhya pradesh civic services  conduct  rules      is concerned  it is not applicable on rss . therefore  the congress leaders are wrong if they say a ban still exists.it is not clear as to why the congress should antagonise the rss in madhya pradesh especially at a time when its president is busy temple hopping and brandishing his newly acquired hindutva identity  janeu and vermillion mark on the forehead. the muslim population in madhya pradesh is  .   per cent and not all of them are voters. the congress lost the state to the bjp mainly due to internecine conflicts and ego clashes among its leaders.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs

raised the bogey of hindus being reduced to minority in jammu region of j k because of the resettlement bill seeking to allow people from kashmir who had migrated to pakistan between      and      to return and reclaim their properties. the congress swept the jammu region     seats  due to the ensuing polarisation. rajiv gandhi in      ordered the opening of the locks of the ayodhya ram temple and used this as an effective campaign issue to garner hindu votes. the bjp launched the famous rath yatra beating the congress in its own game.if preventing the bjp from appropriating the entire hindu vote was the poll strategy the congress was working on  there surely could have been better ways of strategising it. for example  not all temple going hindus are part of the rss. the continuous mandate for the bjp is mainly due to the economic and popular programmes rolled out by three time chief minister shivraj singh chouhan. the congress could have highlighted the flaws in these programmes and kept the rss bashing for another day.shivraj singh chauhan and chhattisgarh chief minister raman singh  although from the rss stable  have an image that is not restricted to being just camp followers. therefore  by demonising the rss  the congress is actually gaining nothing but  on the other hand  helping consolidate the rss voter base in favour of the bjp.also read  shivraj singh chouhan to kamal nath  everyone has a son ready in madhya pradesh politicsas a responsible party that aspires to lead the combined opposition and dislodge the bjp at the centre  the congress leadership needs to show much more maturity and tolerance and work on an alternate economic agenda rather than barking up the wrong tree like demonising the rss. this is a classic example of how to make enemies and lose elections.the rss has made it clear that it does not consider political power as the only and or the ultimate panacea for the problems that the country is facing today or for that matter at any given time. calling itself a cultural organisation  the rss has assiduously distanced itself from electoral politics. yet by virtue of being closely associated with an overwhelming majority of the hindus  it is easy for some political parties  especially during elections  to create rss phobia as a tactic to woo the minority voters.it would not be a bad idea to actually do a research to find out if rss bashing really works as an incentive among minorities to vote against the bjp. nevertheless  rss bashing has become routine during elections although a large section of the minority voters tend to vote for a party for reasons more personal or for economic programmes rather than out of fear.the author is former editor of  organiser .subscribe to our channels on youtube

from congress to bjp  everybody is afraid of obc data
text size  a  a without fresh obc data  caste issues are resolved through muscle power.both narendra modi and manmohan singh governments have collectively spent rs       crore on the socio economic and caste census since     . but even after seven years  the data has not been released. what is it that government is trying to hide and why there must be someone in this country who does not want the reality of the caste demography to emerge. are they the so called hegemonic upper caste people  occupying positions of power in government and bureaucracy  who are scuttling the caste enumeration  or are they the leaders of the bjp and the congress party  who are afraid of uncertainties of such an exercise what we do know is that in post independence india  for the first time  there was an effort to enumerate caste  but we are still waiting for the promised data.the caste enumeration is not a novelty in india. during the british era  castes were counted in decadal census. it s a common practice across the globe  especially in democratic countries  to enumerate the diversity and socio economic disparities of the society in census. these are used to formulate policies and also required for academic exercises. countries usually collect data on race  ethnicities  language  religion  gender and other factors. india also collects data on religion  language and gender. but caste has been a sort of an enigma for policymakers.also read  following the karpoori thakur model  obc sub categorisation could be icing on bjp s cakepost independence  only scheduled castes and scheduled tribes are the two social groups that find place in the census forms because their data is required to fulfil the constitutional obligation of giving them reservation in the lok sabha and state legislatures. the common irrational argument to discourage the enumeration of other castes is that caste census is the root cause of casteism. it is as if caste census gives birth to caste system.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowthe first complete census in india was conducted in     . since then  every tenth year starting      february  government employees  mostly school teachers  go for house to house surveys to count each and every person and collect required information about them. the year      was an exception because the government machinery was busy with world war   and all the tabulations were not completed.in       a different type of census began. the socio economic and caste census  secc       started on    june     . it was similar to the decadal census in a sense that door to door enumeration was to be conducted across the country. according to the central government s announcement and planning  it should have been completed by december     . it was claimed that  the process will go a long way towards meeting the inclusive growth agenda of the government . the data thus collected was to be utilised in the   th five year plan          to         .also read  narendra modi is not part of  us   he isn t a shudra obcthe deadline was shifted several times  and the secc      project was finally completed on    march     . the modi government announced that the project met all its milestones and the cabinet committee on economic affairs had approved the revision of cost for the secc      to rs     .   crore. it is strange that without getting any quantifiable data on caste  the secc      was declared  completed  by the government. the timeline of   th five year plan is over now and we are yet to see any data on caste census.the field data from this exercise was surprising. the secc      came out with           distinct caste names  including sub caste  synonyms  surnames  gotra. the union cabinet in its meeting on    july      decided to constitute an expert group under the leadership of arvind panagariya  the deputy chairman of niti aayog. nothing actually happened after that on this front.professor panagariya is no longer the deputy chairman of the niti aayog. after quitting this assignment  he joined his old position at columbia university. the expert group never met to discuss the caste census as it was never constituted. this was accepted by the government in a written reply to a question in the rajya sabha. hence  there was no possibility of the panel ever submitting its report.so can we safely say that the caste census is dead what may be the possible reason for so many mistakes in data collection  was there a design fault in the data collection  as the registrar general of india explains  or is it about some uncomfortable facts that are emerging from the census  does it have the potential to destabilise the hindu muslim binary  the most potent  and may be deliberate  mistake in the secc      is that the whole exercise was not part of the decadal census.the decadal census is done by the rgi who also holds the office of the census commissioner of india. this decadal census is done with the mandate from the census act of     . the protection of the act is crucial as this prevents citizens from furnishing any wrong information. at the same time  the enumerator can be prosecuted if found guilty of any wrongdoing in noting down the given information.the easiest way to enumerate caste would have been to add a column in      decadal census. it s strange that the government decided to do a separate caste census and spent

because government teachers were not allowed to be deployed for the same  under the right to education act . the exercise was deprived of the knowledge about the local society and the social structures that government teachers bring.it was also a wrong decision to hand over the work of data collection to the state governments because they lacked experience. the secc was conducted non synchronously between      and     . this is not how census should be conducted. the decadal census is done synchronously to avoid duplications that happen due to migrations.this brings the issue of intention. it was never an intention of the manmohan singh government to conduct the caste census. on   and   may      during a short notice discussion  which eventually continued for two days  the lok sabha unanimously supported the inclusion of caste in the census. it seems that the secc was a ploy to ditch this consensus. modi government was also in a position to stop the secc in      and conduct a new caste census. but it continued with the secc. the whole exercise was destined to fail.without any caste data  policymaking is like the blind fishing. officials have to make polices for obcs  they need to provide them loan and scholarship without knowing their actual numbers and their socio economic and educational condition. the union government gives grant to the state government for obc welfare without knowing their numbers in respective states. currently  the practice is to provide central funds based on the total population.also read  what did obc narendra modi do for the obcs what policymakers still use is the      caste census data. the mandal commission had estimated that obcs constitute    per cent of the indian population  based on the      census data. it had recommended inclusion of caste in the census.without fresh data  the caste issues are resolved through muscle power and agitations. this is one of the reasons for violent protests by intermediate castes for inclusion in the obc list. without quantifiable data on caste  no caste can be excluded from the obc list. since mandal commision report was implemented in       not a single caste has been excluded from the obc list because there is no supporting data to show that some of them are no longer backward.modi government is promising an obc census in     . this will again be a huge mistake. there are different central and state lists for the obcs. seven states have more than one list for the backward classes. so  it will not be possible to agree on a consensus list for the obcs. it will be prudent to enumerate all castes in the decadal census in      as it was done in     . the correct way out is to have a separate column for caste in decadal census.the author is a senior

state elections are bad news for bjp and not good news for congress either
text size  a  a while the bjp is going down  the largest opposition party isn t rising to the occasion.first round of pre election opinion polls are in for the coming assembly elections. although the track record of pre election forecasts does not inspire confidence  i still keep an eye on these polls. old habit  i guess. but also because i find imperfect  but not spurious  polls more useful than drawing room or newsroom gossip. the overall trend seems to be this  it s advantage congress in rajasthan and close contests in madhya pradesh  chhattisgarh and now in telangana.on the face of it  this may not be all that bad news for the bjp. i can already see the bjp spin doctors explaining it away  rajasthan regularly flip flops  and if you lose a state like madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh after reigning for    years  that is hardly a matter of shame. but the bjp strategists know that the matter is not so simple. it needs to do well in the three hindi belt states.the bjp won    of    seats in      in rajasthan  madhya pradesh and chhattisgarh. it cannot afford to lose       seats here. a drubbing in rajasthan and a defeat or near defeat in mp is bad news in hard numbers. besides  a setback in these states will be seen as an indication of the way the wind might blow in the hindi belt. it would also be bad news for the moral of party workers going into the lok sabha elections. and it would be bad news as it would encourage more of bad news  literally. a result like this would loosen the bjp s current stranglehold over the media. once the media owners start hedging their bets  a lot of bad news that the regime has managed to keep off from the mass media may begin to reach the people. that is why these elections  mainly the three hindi belt polls with wider ramifications  deserve closer scrutiny.also read  why bjp is staring at a loss of nearly     seats from      tallylet us begin with the headlines. every single agency  csds  c voter  cnx and c fore  agrees that the bjp lags way behind and is in for a drubbing in rajasthan. the estimates of the congress  lead over the bjp vary from   to   percentage points in vote share. on madhya pradesh and chhattisgarh  the polls are split  but none gives comfort to the bjp. while the c voter reported the bjp trailing the congress by one percentage point in madhya pradesh  the csds and cnx polls say the bjp is slightly ahead. it s only in chhattisgarh that the csds poll shows the bjp is comfortably ahead  while the c voter reports the congress is ahead by a wafer thin margin. we don t have many quality polls on telangana  but the latest c voter poll suggests that the congress tdp tjs tie up has reversed the earlier trend of a comfortable lead for the trs.let us use here figures from the csds abp polls for a closer analysis of the three hindi belt states. it s not because of my past association with it  nor because i believe their election forecast over that of others. it s just that the csds team is most transparent in reporting its methodology and findings. you can use their data to disagree with them. also  it so happens that the csds team had carried a similar survey in these three states just before       asked many identical questions and the findings of that survey are also in the public domain.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowthe bjp has three reasons to worry. first  as tables   and   show  the level of anti incumbency in all the three states is deeper than the headlines might suggest. in rajasthan  the vasundhara raje government is nearly as unpopular as the ashok gehlot government was in       just before it was booted out unceremoniously. those who wish to give this government another chance are outnumbered by those who don t   a clear sign of deep anti incumbency. despite the poll showing the bjp in an overall lead in madhya pradesh  the level of satisfaction with shivraj singh chouhan government has plummeted. the ratio of those who wish to boot it out has risen to match those who don t. in chhattisgarh too  the proportion of dissatisfied and those who want to throw the government out has increased. in other words  the bjp is more vulnerable in madhya pradesh than it might appear and is not invincible in chhattisgarh.table     how satisfied are you with the performance of the state government  table     should this state government get another chance  second  in each of the states  the bjp does worse in rural areas than in the cities. this could prove decisive in madhya pradesh. the csds poll shows the bjp in overall lead  but trailing behind the congress in the rural areas. this could mean that the bjp scores big victories in a small number of urban seats but loses a large number of seats by a small margin. a similar logic appears to be at work in rajasthan and chhattisgarh as well. this could be the sign of a wider trend throughout the hindi belt  something that must worry the bjp leaders.also read  china is the reason why modi is giving up precious campaigning hours in   state electionsfinally  the bjp leadership would worry because the major issues identified by the voters are likely to hurt the party all over the country. unemployment has been topping the chart of issues in all the national surveys for the past one year. it trumps as the voting consideration among these three states  upstaging the usual favourites like price rise  poverty and corruption. this could again point to a wider pattern  beyond these three states. while the central government is not seen to be corrupt  the information about the nirav modi scandal and the rafale deal seems to be percolating down to more than one third of the voters. this could go up further if the media picks up more courage after this verdict.all this should be music to the congress  ears. yet a moment s reflection shows that this is more a negative vote against the bjp rather than a positive vote for the congress. none of the congress cm aspirants is more popular than the current bjp cm in each of these three states. the level of satisfaction with the central government is fairly high  higher than it was with the upa government in     . more importantly  narendra modi continues to be the top choice for the pm s post  even in rajasthan. while the party that wins the assembly election tends to take the state in the subsequent lok sabha elections  it should worry the congress that rahul gandhi is not liked very much in rajasthan. while the bjp is going down  the largest opposition party is not generating any positivity and hope. and that is a story not limited to these three states.yogendra yadav is national president of swaraj india.subscribe to our channels on youtube   telegramnews media is in a crisis   only you can fix it

from rajiv gandhi to modi  nobody defines  muslim appeasement  but all use it for votes
text size  a  a the idea of  muslim appeasement  has haunted indian politics for nearly three decades.the strength of hindutva politics practiced by parties like the bjp and shiv sena in recent years has relied on two interlinked rhetorical devices   that hindus are victims in secular india  and muslims have been appeased in the name of secularism since independence.and yet no one has defined the phrase  muslim appeasement .in a speech dedicated to deen dayal upadhyaya  the founder of jana sangh and the official ideologue of the bjp  narendra modi said   fifty years ago  pandit upadhyaya said  do not reward appease  puraskrit  muslims  do not shun  tiraskrit  them but purify  parishkar  them . do not treat muslims like vote ki mandi ka maal  vote banks  or ghrina ki vastu  object of hatred . unhe apna samjho  regard them as your own . this was not the first time when narendra modi  like other bjp leaders  invoked the term  muslim appeasement  to criticise the policies  programmes and actions of non bjp political parties. although the meaning of the term  muslim appeasement  is not elaborated in the speech  modi was able to make his point. he was certainly referring to the alleged privileges given to muslims in india  which  in his imagination of sabka sath sabka vikas  had to be condemned for not achieving real development.modi cannot be singled out for using ambiguous  vague and unclear expressions to outline the distinctiveness of his party. the idea of  muslim appeasement  has haunted indian politics for nearly three decades  but never really been given any adequate intellectual attention.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowalso read  what explains the muslim silence in the face of bjp s aggressive hindutva what is muslim appeasement broadly speaking  muslim appeasement is referred to at least in two aspects of politics regarding muslims  biased institutional apparatus and unfair political practices.the constitutional provisions related to rights of religious minorities  which offer legal protection to autonomous bodies such islamic endowments knows as waqf  the muslim personal law and educational institutions such as the aligarh muslim university  are seen as problematic and unfair. it is asserted that minority rights goes against the spirit of religious equality and secularism based on rule of law.in an article published in the     s called minorities problems and its solution  written by balraj madhok  one of rss s known intellectuals  the problematic aspects of the constitution are outlined. he says  articles        and      which are discriminatory being in favour of minorities should be abrogated from the constitution of india. such provisions be made in the constitution that no discrimination between the citizens of india will be made by the government on the basis of religions or methods of worship.  .such muslims and other minorities who are not prepared to abjure their separatist tendencies should be declared foreigners  and they should be divested of the right of franchise.  muslim appeasement  is also used to denote specific forms of political practices. the assurance given to muslims by the political parties with regard to educational and or economic empowerment  distribution of tickets to muslim candidates in elections and even declaration of holidays on muslim religious festivals are treated as  muslim appeasement . a resolution passed by the rss in      is an example of this critique  the akhil bharatiya karyakari mandal  abkm  decries the return of the demon of minority appeasement under the present upa government. its earlier decision to provide     reservation for muslims in aligarh muslim university and its attempts now to go in appeal against the hc order on the minority status of the aligarh muslim university is a standing proof of its appeasement policy  also reprehensible is the reported directive given to all the chief ministers of the congress ruled states to emulate andhra pradesh government in extending reservations to muslims.  secular  responseinterestingly  the secular critique of hindutva s imagination of  muslim appeasement   does not propose any alternative idea. although they tend to talk of the multi layered structure of the muslim community and its relative marginalisation  the possibilities of appeasement  its meanings  forms and impacts are not given any serious intellectual political attention. muslim appeasement  is simply refuted as hindutva propaganda.even those scholars  who are critical of hindu as well as muslim communalism  could not produce any significant analysis of  muslim appeasement .mushirul hasan s assessment of the shah bano moment of indian politics is a good example to underline this confusion. he writes  debates on the uniform civil code have gone on ceaselessly since independence. muslim orthodoxy was unequivocally opposed to change  and the liberal view became increasingly blurred because of the unhappy intervention of hindu ideologues as vocal proponents of reform in muslim personal law .. the government dare not change its strategy for fear of losing muslim votes .rajiv gandhi imposed a ban on salman rushdie s the satanic verses and his successor v.p. singh declared prophet mohammad s birthday a national holiday. finally  muslims were willfully appeased by the muslim women  protection of rights on divorce  act        and through official reluctance to enact a uniform civil code.  emphases added  mushirul hasan  legacy of a divided nation oxford university press        p.     it is certainly clear from this passage that hasan is condemning the hindutva politics  which appropriated the ucc debate. he is equally critical of the islamic orthodoxy  which was supported by the state in the shah bano case. yet  hasan fails to specify his meaning of  muslim appeasement  and we are left with a few puzzling questions  does muslim appeasement only mean the political moves of the rajiv gandhi government  or  does it mean that all muslims were going to vote for rajiv gandhi in the election because they were  wilfully appeased  in the shah bano case  if this is the case  how is hasan s notion of muslim appeasement different from the rss  conceptualisation also read    myths about muslim voters in modern indiamuslim appeasement in post sachar erathe publication of the sachar report in      gave a new twist to the idea of muslim appeasement. as an official document  the report underlines the fact that muslims of india are socially  economically and educationally backward and marginalised. although the report very categorically emphasises upon the highly diverse and deeply stratified structure of muslim community  the  muslim victimhood  as a new template of indian politics began to take shape.the report was invoked  particularly by non bjp parties  to demonstrate that  muslim appeasement  was a myth created by the hindutva forces and muslims must be treated as an excluded community.hindutva politics also refashioned itself in the light of this response. it was argued that the congress did not show any serious interest in the empowerment of muslims   they were treated as a vote bank  which led to marginalisation and exclusion  and that the bjp s firm commitment to equal treatment to all  as the argument goes  helped even the muslims to prosper in bjp ruled states. l.k. advani s assessed the sachar report thus    i feel gujarat should be grateful to justice sachar for proving convincingly to the country that under narendra bhai modi s regime  muslims are far better off than their compatriots in other states. this argument later evolved into the party s rhetoric   development of all  appeasement of none .now   muslim appeasement  has found a new political life in post      india. the bjp has successfully established the fact that addressing muslims as muslims is an act of appeasement. the impact of this assertion is so powerful that even the so called secular  anti hindutva  and non bjp parties have gradually started distancing themselves from muslims  simply to avoid the tag of muslim appeasement.muslim appeasement and  good muslims the assumption of  muslim appeasement  relies on muslim homogeneity   an undifferentiated picture of a single muslim community. however  the recognised  good muslims  in all political parties are never treated as beneficiaries of appeasement. in fact  these  good muslims  struggle with each other as organic intellectuals   either to refute  muslim appeasement  as a myth or to evoke the  development of all  appeasement of none  slogan.the presence of these  good muslims  underlines the fact that  muslim appeasement  is not a description of an objective socio political condition of muslims  rather it is a metaphor of politics.also read  the good muslim bad muslim binary is as old as nehruthe unclear  ambiguous metaphor is cleverly employed to create a  fear psyche  among muslims. it tells muslims that they are a pampered lot   even as they experience deprivation   and creates a psychological dissonance. this state prevents them from seeking equity or justice.the modi led bjp is not an exception in this regard. the muslim faces of the bjp   mukhtar abbas naqvi  zafar islam and najma heptulla   are elite muslims  who are being appeased in the name of sab ka sath sabka vikas.yes   good muslims  are always appeased.hilal ahmed is an associate professor  centre for the study of developing societies. theprint is publishing three series on minorities in india by scholar of political islam hilal

bjp and congress use tipu sultan for politics but are shockingly ignorant of his history
text size  a  a tipu sultan is simply another useful historical figure onto whom contemporary political prejudices can be projected.the month of november has become more malignant and politically heated in karnataka. once it used to be the month of rajyotsava  the state founding day celebrations  benign discourses on the past greatness of kannada or lamentations over the loss of its eminence in an increasingly globalised world. since       the spectre of tipu sultan looms large over the old mysuru region  which he ruled  and neighbouring coorg  mangalore and malabar where his political opponents were cruelly dealt with.tipu sultan s birthday celebration as a state sponsored event has turned into an ideological battle between the secular left and the hindu right. whether the historical tipu conforms to how he is projected in this battle hasn t really been relevant. he is simply another useful historical figure onto whom contemporary political prejudices can be projected.the actual event doesn t matter. chief minister h.d. kumaraswamy has decided to skip the celebrations  citing health reasons. he needs his rest. lest we forget  kumaraswamy had opposed tipu jayanti in the past. his deputy  g. parameshwara  will be the chief guest at a ceremony which will probably not be held in the banquet hall of the vidhana soudha  but at the nearby ravindra kalakshetra auditorium. optics do matter.also read  tipu jayanti goes to karnataka hc  sabarimala style flashpoint or real historical debate when the siddaramaiah government decided to initiate tipu jayanti celebrations in       it simply extended to muslims what had by then become a bipartisan practice  of celebrating birthdays of iconic cultural heroes of numerically large  and therefore  electorally significant caste or religious groups. in fact  the previous bjp government had instituted jayanti celebrations of valmiki  parivara nayaka caste   basavanna  lingayats  and kanakadasa  kuruba . state holidays were also declared on these days.not to be left behind  the siddaramaiah government also launched celebrations of krishna janmashtami  golla yadava caste  and vishwakarma jayanti. competitive casteism has found its place in public life. this was in addition to celebrating the birthdays of dr ambedkar  dalit  and poet kuvempu  vokkaliga . on each of these days  the state administration organises a public procession and a lecture  in which ministers and officials participate. this takes place at the state secretariat in bengaluru and district centres.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowwhile none of these above mentioned choices was controversial  picking an icon for muslims has been tricky. the bjp  for whom tipu is the paradigmatic  bad muslim   has consistently opposed celebrating his birthday. as an alternative  it has often proposed the   th century kannada saint poet  shishunala sharifa. a disciple of govinda bhatta  an advaitin teacher  sharifa is known for his mystical philosophical poems.objections to tipu sultan are many. his critics argue that tipu and his father hyder ali were illegitimate usurpers  who snatched political power from the wodeyar kings of mysuru. they further characterise him as a cruel  religious bigot  who forcibly converted tens of thousands in coorg  mangalore and malabar regions  he is accused of slaughtering those who refused to convert to islam. tipu sultan is also projected as an opponent of kannada  since he used persian as the administrative language. even his patronage of hindu temples is dismissed as a strategic measure rather than something borne out of genuine respect for other religions. these arguments have been made forcefully by eminent kannada writer s.l. bhyrappa and journalist turned politician  pratap simha  who represents the mysore coorg constituency in lok sabha.also read  karnataka bjp plans protests on tipu jayanti to call out congress jd s   double standards tipu s critics aren t factually incorrect. but nuance has no place in their formulations. tipu did resort to conversion and even slaughtering of his opponents in newly conquered regions or in areas where he encountered armed resistance. rarely did he deploy such strategies in the heartland of his kingdom. on the contrary  he often made large gifts to temples in sringeri and several other places in his kingdom. some of these temples were  in fact  looted by maratha generals during the regime of hyder ali and tipu sultan. a more careful reading of the historical evidence suggests that tipu s actions were perhaps largely motivated by political considerations than religious ones. moreover  both father and son were extremely capable generals and efficient administrators. in the   th century political context  their assumption of political authority in mysuru was no different than how power was captured by their contemporaries like the marathas  and hence  no less legitimate.tipu advocates too are susceptible to losing sight of nuance  and consequently  making crude historical formulations. in their accounts  tipu is a secular  nationalist  freedom fighter. surely  hyder and tipu were among the most formidable opponents that the british empire faced in the   th century. but that doesn t make them either secular or anti colonial nationalists. both these categories appear anachronistic and not especially useful for a discussion of   th century indian politics.absent in this entire discussion is a willingness to see tipu sultan as an   th century political figure. this is a charge both sides are guilty of. what further vitiates public discourse is the lack of credible historical scholarship on hyder and tipu. australian historian kate brittlebank is perhaps the only professional historian to have written monographs on tipu. apart from her writings  the interested reader might find an occasional journal article or a book chapter. scholarship in indian languages  especially in kannada and urdu  too isn t impressive qualitatively. so  our historical understanding of late   th century mysuru politics is limited.also read  don t give modern character certificates to rulers like khilji or tiputhis facilitates the november heat of the political farce over tipu. charges are traded. pils are filed in the karnataka high court  seeking a stay on the celebration of tipu jayanti. the high court will refuse to grant a stay but will ask the state government to maintain law and order. media wars are waged in television studios and newspapers. bjp s central ministers and mps warn the state administration not to print their names in any tipu jayanti programme. state ministers insist that protocol dictates the inclusion of the names of all peoples  representatives  with no exception. it appears both sides delight in re enacting the same ritual every year.prithvi datta chandra shobhi is a mysuru based social historian and

after us midterm elections  india needs to build bridges with more congress members
text size  a  a new delhi will have to cautiously watch the situation and be ready to convince us congress to boost india s national interest.the us midterm election results have tilted the balance in the house of representatives in favour of the democrats  and prime minister narendra modi s government now needs to increase its contacts with the new members of congress.the midterm elections  marking two years of president donald trump in the white house  is probably the first countrywide test of his popularity and the republican party s future prospects in     . the us congress made up of the house of representatives and the senate are now controlled by two parties  the democrats in the house of representatives and the republicans in the senate. the midterm election results  seen more as a referendum of trump s policies  are important for new delhi to study and take note of.although these results do not necessarily impact trump s foreign policy  they could  however  impact the decision making process in congress. prominent among those who have won in the midterm elections are former presidential candidate mitt romney who has returned to the public stage after winning a senate seat in utah. mike pence s brother greg pence has won from the vice president s former house of representative seat in indiana. meanwhile  bernie sanders and a few potential democratic presidential candidates   elizabeth warren and kirsten gillibrand   have all been re elected to the senate.also read  us midterm polls  voter anger with donald trump hands democrats house controlwhile trump has hailed the senate results as a  great victory  for his party and policies  the democrats have already begun to interpret the results as a negative vote for trump and are looking to block his policies in the house.when the house of representative meets in january       it is likely to elect a strong anti trump person to lead the attack on trump. besides  the democrats will control all of the committees that will be crucial in making policies and implementing them.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowthere is a growing clamour among the democrat voters for the impeachment of trump  but the lawmakers know that it is easier said than done. without sufficient numbers in the senate and the support of republican senators opposed to trump  the house can only initiate impeachment proceedings but not get it passed in the senate. going by the speeches made by nancy pelosi  the democrats are likely to cooperate with the trump administration in domestic politics and strategise to gain greater support from youth and women voters.while the modi trump equation seems to be working well for new delhi  just as the modi obama equation did  it is difficult to tell if new delhi will find the relations smooth if there is a confrontation in the us congress. needless to say  india will have to invest more into networking and build bridges with a greater number of congress

rahul gandhi will benefit from personal jibes just like narendra modi once did
text size  a  a the narendra modi amit shah duopoly have made the same mistake as the congress.rahul gandhi is no longer a political  untouchable . andhra pradesh chief minister and president of telugu desam party  n. chandrababu naidu s reach out to congress president rahul gandhi is one indication.if they were really honest in their self appraisal  the narendra modi amit shah duopoly cannot but conclude that they may have made the same mistake as the congress did since      when it constantly targeted modi. history tells us that modi has reasons to thank leaders of the congress party for repeatedly heaping slurs on him   whether it was sonia gandhi s maut ka saudagar barb or mani shankar aiyar s neech aadmi insult.consistent verbal assaults on modi for his hindutva politics over a considerable period of time eventually resulted in the saffron fold closing their ranks behind then gujarat chief minister.also read  rahul gandhi can t imitate modi to defeat modilikewise  by ridiculing rahul gandhi for almost five years from early       modi might just have ended up benefiting the congress president. the pappufication of rahul gandhi surely provided reasons for much mirth among modi believers  but it also elevated rahul gandhi s public stature because of a basic law of public response  anyone who is viciously and repeatedly attacked by an adversary is never seen as dim witted and inconsequential. after all  only the foe with the capacity to pose a serious challenge is scoffed at.the situation has altered stunningly from that in the immediate aftermath of the party s sweep of uttar pradesh in march       when modi s return was considered a  settled affair . now  it is time for modi to deliberate if he and his party had erred by personally targeting rahul gandhi over the past five years.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe nowthis is why chandrababu naidu s handshake with rahul gandhi last week is significant.first  it heralds the willingness of regional parties opposed to the bjp s political dominance to ally with the congress under rahul gandhi s leadership. this was a situation unimaginable till recently because of doubts about his capabilities. already  dmk president m.k. stalin has welcomed this meeting stating that regional parties must unite to defeat bjp.second  the handshake and decision of the two to speak the same political language indicate that regional parties previously steeped in anti congressism  are now looking at anti bjpism as its immediate doctrine.this poses a hurdle to the bjp s objective of securing re election in     . but  the consequences of the inability to return to office are greater for the personal political fortunes of modi and shah  than for the bjp or the sangh parivar. so  it is for the two leaders to evaluate if their barbs are shrinking rahul gandhi s image or making him into a legitimate opponent.also read  the real      fight isn t between rahul gandhi and narendra modieventually  rahul gandhi did turn the jibe against him on its head with the theatrical speech in lok sabha in july this year.rahul gandhi thanked modi and the bjp for castigating him over and over again because this  he claimed  taught him what the congress was  what it meant to be an indian and  above all  what it meant to be a hindu.in parliament  modi chuckled when he heard rahul gandhi declare that he did not have an iota of hatred towards modi and the sangh parivar even though he was repeatedly called pappu. modi s nervous laughter and his unsure response to the mother of all hugs was a pointer to the realisation of the impact of rahul gandhi s audacity to own that derisive label.previously  he had also turned around the shehzade taunt at amit shah s son  jay  after allegations of corruption surfaced against him.with these  the congress president virtually defanged the social media campaign against him. this also coincided with the period when modi lost his mojo and rahul roared to life on twitter.it was the bjp s misdirected assault that provided credibility to his  main congress hoon  claim. indeed  the more the bjp mocked rahul gandhi  the more they strengthened him  not just within his own party  but even among the opposition ranks  as chandrababu naidu s decision to seek him out shows.by targeting rahul gandhi more than other opposition leaders  the bjp effectively accepted the congress and his position as the principal challenger. the present scenario makes it necessary for astute opposition leaders to accept the congress as the first among equals.also read  here s why modi gets away with his gaffes  while rahul gandhi gets called pappumodi  in fact  overlooked his own experience that indians back underdogs and are inherently prone to questioning authority. that there has been only one instance when an authoritarian leader held sway   indira gandhi post           indicates the free thinking spirit of the people.yet  for a leader who benefited greatly by depicting himself as an outsider delegitimised by the congress  modi is curiously choosing to undermine rahul gandhi in a similar way.the author is a political columnist who wrote  narendra modi  the man  the times subscribe

there is a new congress in town and it s the bharatiya janata party
text size  a  a congress  which ruled india for    years  is becoming a role model for bjp as it eyes a similar stint at the helm.narendra modi and amit shah had once set out to achieve a  congress mukt bharat   but the bharatiya janata party  bjp  is increasingly becoming a replica of what they wanted to rid the country of.the bjp has  for sure  replaced the congress as the single most dominant party in india  but has  in the process  assimilated many attributes the opposition party has been known for  the high command ist culture  premium on loyalty and sycophancy  promotion of leaders with no mass base  nepotism  and pervasive cliques around power centres  you name it.in an incisive article last week  my colleague ruhi tewari wrote how one has started getting a sense of d j  vu as the last year of the narendra modi government has started resembling that of dr manmohan singh s.it would be premature to jump to any conclusions though  as even modi s detractors concede that he is teflon coated  there is no evidence yet to suggest any erosion in his public image despite implosions in one institution after another.this factor should have impelled the bjp to reinforce its brand image   or whatever is left of it   as the party with a difference. on the contrary  it appears to have accelerated the process of the bjp s  congressisation .the party that ruled india for    years is becoming a role model for bjp leaders who believe it s their turn to rule the country for    years.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is expensive and needs readers to pay for it. your support will define our work and theprint s future. subscribe now modiji ko jai shri ram speeches at the two day convention of the bjp s youth wing  the bharatiya janata yuva morcha  bjym   in hyderabad over the weekend were a testimony to the influence the congress has had even on young bjp leaders.the gist of young tripura chief minister biplab kumar deb s speech was how modi had become the  messiah of the poor of the world .  amit bhai ko  jai shri ram   modiji ko  jai shri ram   was how mp anurag thakur started his speech saturday.deb  of course  has reasons to be grateful to modi and shah. they appointed him the chief minister despite his rival  a senior bjp leader who supervised the party s poll management in the state  threatening at an internal meeting attended by shah that he would take poison if deb was given the top job in the state  say party insiders.also read  congress goes bjp way to draft manifesto for      lok sabha electionsthe three day bjym meeting that was expected to discuss the party s agenda for the youth turned out to be a modi centric exercise  with most speakers  including many senior cabinet ministers and chief ministers  taking turns to shower encomium on the prime minister.between sessions  the  namo yuva  song was played and the  star cast  of chalo jeete hain  a film inspired by modi s childhood  was invited to the dais sunday.the only discordant note  though veiled  seemed to have come from union minister nitin gadkari  when he said that the bjp always functioned on the basis of its ideologies and principles  and not in any vyakti or person s name.yes men have a field daylike in the congress  yes men have come to occupy important positions in the party.look at the list of bjp office bearers and even ministers picked by shah to carry out his plans in states. most of them haven t won a single election.let s look at the list of the party s national general secretaries  the most important position after the bjp president. bhupendra yadav is the bjp s general secretary in charge of the politically crucial states of bihar and gujarat  but he has never contested an election   that is  if one discounts the rajya sabha elections.anil jain  general secretary in charge of chhattisgarh and haryana  has never contested an election. nor have p. muralidhar rao  general secretary in charge of karnataka and tamil nadu  and arun singh  general secretary in charge of odisha.also read  modi shah bhagwat play good cop bad cop to win      electionsthis list of never contested never elected top leaders of the bjp gets much longer if one includes ministers who are picked by shah for poll management.human resource development minister prakash javadekar  for instance  was recently appointed election in charge for rajasthan. his credentials for the job   two terms in the maharashtra legislative council and two in the rajya sabha. just imagine two term chief minister vasundhara raje  the only bjp leader with mass appeal in rajasthan  taking lessons in poll management from javadekar the irony is  many bjp leaders have strong objections to indirectly elected rajya sabha members vetoing legislations passed by the lok sabha because  they contend  the latter represents the will of the people.premium on loyalty and friendshiplook at the list of chief ministers   those who have come to occupy the post under the modi shah regime.indira gandhi had set out to demolish satraps in the congress to consolidate her position at the centre. the congress chief ministers she hand picked owed their chairs to their loyalty to her  and not to their popularity as a leader.from      onwards  modi and shah have hand picked cms   though with the apparent objective to develop new leadership  but most of them have proved to be a liability for the party.lack of internal democracythere was a time when there were serious consultations within the party over issues.ahead of the maharashtra assembly elections in       amit shah had visited arun jaitley in hospital around midnight to discuss whether the party should go it alone as the shiv sena was flexing its muscle demanding more seats.it was jaitley who weighed in favour of the alliance and that became the party line. bjp insiders say that consultations still happen   but they happen to secure pro forma endorsement of decisions already taken .most of the internal party meetings go one way now  on the lines of the weekly bjp parliamentary party meetings when parliament is in session.in the first few months  modi  shah or some senior minister in their presence addressed the mps and the latter were allowed to ask questions or seek clarifications.also read  this is the success rate of bjp s old strategy of denying tickets to serving mlasthey have been reduced to being mute audiences now  just as the congress mps have long been at the parliamentary party meetings.like in the congress  the appointment of even a district bjp chief is cleared by the party s national president. like in the congress  it s the bjp chief who would decide when to reshuffle the maharashtra cabinet and who to induct or drop. not that chief minister devendra fadnavis would feel slighted.the many congresses of indiathings are no different in other parties. bahujan samaj party leaders don t even share their views with one another on an issue until mayawati speaks or issues instructions.biju janata dal mps remain non committal on any bill in parliament until they hear from naveen patnaik. and the same goes for most other parties.therefore  the congressisation of the bjp may not set any alarm bells ringing in the saffron party at this stage.as long as the congress had towering leaders with the mass appeal to get the party elected  the centralisation of power and undermining of democratic norms  values and processes in the party did not cause any immediate concern.the bjp has one in modi today. but what happens to such a party in the absence of such a leader or when his or her charisma wanes  that s a lesson the bjp can draw from the congress.subscribe to our channels on youtube

coa split on rahul johri sexual harassment charges shows vinod rai has dropped the ball
text size  a  a coa member diana edulji wanted bcci ceo rahul johri to resign or be removed  but chief vinod rai insisted on setting up a three member inquiry panel.two s company  three s a crowd. this is a phrase most of us are familiar with  in one context or another. but the honourable supreme court of india could not have anticipated that the same idiom works in reverse as well.in june       ramachandra guha resigned from the court appointed committee of administrators   a grandiose term for a set of four   leaving vinod rai with diana edulji and vikram limaye for company. when limaye

serious division between rai and edulji.more than a difference of opinionrai chose to maintain a studied silence since the allegations against johri became public  before  during and after the  metoo movement on social media that has resulted in the resignation or dismissal of several prominent persons from their posts  including a minister. rai s committee issued a public statement thursday night after receiving multiple letters of complaint from state associations of the bcci.we are deeply grateful to our readers   viewers for their time  trust and subscriptions. quality journalism is

of natural justice  an independent committee comprising of distinguished persons who are knowledgeable in this field should conduct a fair and transparent inquiry on an arm s length basis and submit a report containing its findings and recommendation on the way forward   it said. the independent committee could take into account and or probe all allegations of sexual harassment against mr johri while he was employed with the bcci. critically  this part of the statement restricts the ambit of the independent committee to allegations against johri  while he was employed with the bcci   which is a clear attempt to distance the committee from the social media posts that came to light accusing johri of similar actions when he was a high profile executive employed by the discovery channel prior to his time in the bcci.but  more importantly  rai found himself in a minority of one in a committee of two  perhaps for the first time since he has taken over the running of indian cricket.edulji  a distinguished former women s cricketer  approached the issue differently. her view was that  since the ceo has such grave sexual harassment allegations against him  it would not be in the interests of bcci and indian cricket that he represents bcci. in view of this she suggested that he resigns or his contract be terminated .rai disagreed  arguing that others in similar situations were allowed to continue in harness even as investigations were under way. this is patently false  as it was rai s committee which suspended mohammed shami s central contract when allegations of a similar nature   later found to be baseless   were levelled against him.rai drops the balltheprint further understands that one of the reasons edulji took such a hardline stance was because johri s written response to the allegations was not sent to the committee of administrators but only to rai.the chairman then shared the response with the amicus curiae   friend of the court    gopal subramanium  to close the loop. attempts to contact johri  rai and edulji to confirm that this was the sequence of events remained unanswered.also read  vinod rai s panel still to act despite two  metoo allegations against bcci ceo rahul johriwhat has become patently clear  however  is that the coa realises this is the worst possible environment to try and brazen it out  on an issue that has caught the public imagination like never before.that a seasoned administrator such as rai would have even considered this an option  given how little action he took and how late  only reinforces the belief that has been held in many quarters in indian cricket since he arrived on the scene  he talks a good game  is notionally the right man for the job  but practically  has done nothing to improve how the game is run.when indian cricket made its clarion call to rai  it seems like he has faced his own  g moment. he has dropped the ball  if not the call.subscribe to our channels on
